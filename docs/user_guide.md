## What it does

Puts your Kohler Konnect devices in Home Assistant under one sign-in: the shower — outlets,
temperature, presets, and the Anthem Plus controller's music, lighting and steam — and the
Sensate kitchen faucet — water on and off, measured dispenses, presets and leak alerts.

No official Kohler integration exists for these products. The community integrations that do
exist support only the older, simpler Anthem valve. This one was built by reverse-engineering
Kohler's Konnect cloud protocol from captured traffic on real hardware.

Shower state arrives by **push, not polling.** The integration subscribes to Kohler's Azure
IoT Hub MQTT stream and updates the moment the hardware reports a change (`iot_class:
cloud_push`, `SCAN_INTERVAL = None`). REST is read once at setup, and again on each reconnect
to reseed — the broker replays nothing when you connect, so the state has to come from
somewhere. Faucets share that one stream and also poll, as a safety net — see
[How it works](#how-it-works).

## At a glance

* **Every device, one integration.** The Anthem valve, the Anthem+ controller and the
  Sensate faucet each appear as their own device, and an account can have any mix of them.
* **Push-based.** Nothing polls a shower. Changes made at the touchscreen, in the Konnect
  app, or by the hardware itself show up in Home Assistant within seconds. Faucets also poll,
  as a safety net.
* **Per-outlet control.** Every outlet is a switch; every zone has a temperature number.
* **Presets and favorites.** The valve's stored presets and the controller's named
  favorites are both exposed as dropdowns.
* **Warmup.** Kohler's pre-heat feature as a three-option dropdown, with an optional watchdog
  that puts it back when something silently turns it off.
* **One-command shower.** A `custom_shower` action: choose outlets and temperatures, and it
  goes to the valve as a single command — the form to use from an automation, because the valve
  cannot take two commands back to back. Optionally keeps the shower on past the valve's
  warm-up pause (beta).
* **Raw escape hatch.** A `send_valve_hex` service for anything the normal controls cannot do.
* **Faucet dispenses.** One-tap amounts, a free-choice amount, Konnect presets, and a
  `dispense` action for automations and voice — with a water safety limit for water turned on
  from Home Assistant.
* **Water used** today, this week, this month and this year, for valves and faucets alike —
  Kohler's own figures, the ones the Konnect app charts.
* **Diagnostics built in.** A Report Log switch for bug reports, and a raw MQTT capture for
  deeper digging — see [Diagnostics](#diagnostics).

## Two shower products

Kohler sells two different things under the Anthem name, and an account can have either or
both. They speak different protocols, and most confusion about this system comes from
assuming there is one device when there are two.

| | **Anthem** (the valve) | **Anthem+** (the controller) |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | The digital valve itself, Wi-Fi built in | A Linux controller sitting in front of the valve |
| Adds | — | Music (needs a K-30319 amplifier), lighting, steam, a second valve body |
| Controlled by | A raw hex command word — temperature, flow, outlet mask | Activating named favorites |
| Granularity | Any outlet, any temperature, any time | Whole scenes only |
| In the code and docs | `GCS` | `HUB` |

A physical Anthem valve is **one unit containing two zones**, each with up to three outlets.

Four valve models exist, and the integration knows the outlet split for each:

| Model | Outlets | Zone 1 | Zone 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| K-28209 | 2 | 2 | — |
| K-28210 | 3 | 3 | — |
| K-28211 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| K-28212 | 6 | 3 | 3 |

An installation that doesn't match one of these four still works — an unrecognised outlet
split produces a usable model rather than an error.

> ⚠️ **Digital Anthem, not the mechanical Anthem.** Kohler sells both under that name. Only
> the digital, network-connected one has an API to talk to.

## Sensate faucets

The **Sensate** is Kohler's touchless kitchen faucet. Through Konnect it can run water, stop
it, and pour a measured amount — a dispense — at the temperature the handle is set to; it has
no temperature or flow command. It also keeps a leak history and its own list of dispense
presets, made in the Konnect app.

| | **Sensate** |
|---|---|
| Controlled by | Plain commands: water on, water off, dispense *n* litres |
| Presets | Saved in the Konnect app; this integration pours them, it does not create them |
| Blocks remote water | A closed handle, or a firmware download — as the Konnect app does |
| In the code and docs | `SEN` (and `SET`, a second faucet the app treats identically — probably the Setra) |

## How it works

**Two APIs, in two directions.** Commands go out over Kohler's Konnect REST API. State comes
back over Azure IoT Hub MQTT, which Kohler's cloud pushes to. Nothing polls a shower's state.

**REST is read at setup and on reconnect, not on a timer.** Once at setup, and again on every
MQTT reconnect. The broker replays no history on connect, so without that reseed the
integration would sit blind until the hardware happened to say something. Beyond that, REST is
read only for a reason: firmware, checked twice a day; water usage, after a shower ends; and
the faucets, below.

**The valve is commanded with a hex word.** Temperature, flow and an outlet bitmask packed
into four bytes. Temperature is a 10-bit value spanning two bytes — `°C = ((byte0 & 0x03) << 8
| byte1) / 10` — so `0x184` (388) is 38.8 °C, or 101.8 °F. Flow is a single byte from `0x10`
(16) to `0xC8` (200), where `0xC8` (200) is 100 %. The full breakdown, including the outlet
mask and the pause bit, is in [`gcs/valve_hex.md`](gcs/valve_hex.md).

**The controller is not commanded that way.** It only activates named favorites — whole
scenes configured in the Konnect app, combining outlets, temperature, lighting, music and
steam. You cannot ask it for "outlet 2 at 39 °C"; that goes to the valve.

**All are cloud-only.** The controller exposes a local LAN API, but it can read
configuration and cannot actuate anything.

**One connection for everything.** The MQTT stream is per account, not per device, so one
connection carries every valve's, controller's and faucet's messages, and each goes to the
device it names.

**Faucets also poll.** Each faucet has its own polling loop, inherited from the separate
faucet integration this one replaced, where it was settled against a real faucet. It polls
every 30 seconds while idle and every 5 while water runs, and relaxes to every 5 minutes (30
seconds while running) once the stream has delivered a message about that faucet. If a poll
ever finds a change the stream did not announce, polling takes charge again until the stream
delivers. Its configuration and presets are re-read every 5 minutes. Its daily water usage is
re-read every 30 minutes and about 2 minutes after the water stops; the monthly history behind
This Year, like a valve's, only at startup and when the month turns.

## In Home Assistant

One device per product, each with its own entities: an **Anthem Valve** for each valve on
the account, an **Anthem Plus** for each controller, and a device for each faucet, named as
it is in the Konnect app (**Kitchen**, say).

**Several of either.** An account with more than one valve or controller — one per
bathroom, say — gets one device per unit, each with the full set of entities, its own
favorites and settings (Warmup Auto-Restore is per valve), and each decoding outlets with the layout its own hardware reports,
so a 6-outlet valve and a 3-outlet valve on one account each get the right rows. To keep
their entity IDs apart, the devices are named after the unit's name in the Konnect app:
**Anthem Valve Master Bath**, **Anthem Plus Guest Bath**, and so on. With a single valve
or controller the device is plainly **Anthem Valve** or **Anthem Plus**, as it always was.
The `custom_shower` and `send_valve_hex` actions show a **Valve** field to say which valve
they are for. It appears only when there is more than one — with a single valve there is
nothing to choose, so the field is not shown, just as Zone 2 is not shown on a single-zone
valve.

## Entities

Entity IDs below assume the default device names **Anthem Valve** and **Anthem Plus**. If you
rename a device, its entity IDs change with it — and on an account with several valves or
controllers the default name already carries the Konnect name, so `switch.anthem_plus_shower`
becomes `switch.anthem_plus_master_bath_shower` and `switch.anthem_valve_shower_on` becomes
`switch.anthem_valve_master_bath_shower_on`.

### How entities are named

**On a single-zone valve — K-28209 and K-28210 — nothing carries a zone number.**
`Temperature` and `Flow` say everything a number would, and there's no `Shower Active`:
`System Status` already reports whether water is running, warming up, or paused.

**A multi-zone valve numbers each zone as a suffix:** `Temperature 1` and `Temperature 2`,
`Rainhead 1` and `Rainhead 2`. The number trails rather than leading (`Zone 2 Temperature`)
so related entities sort together in every Home Assistant list. Where one zone has two
outlets of the same fixture, the fixture takes its own number too — `Showerhead 1`,
`Showerhead 2` — and on a multi-zone valve the two combine as `Showerhead 1.2` (the second
showerhead in zone 1). An outlet whose type the valve hasn't reported falls back to its
position: `Outlet 1`, or `Outlet 2.1` on a multi-zone valve.

### Multi-zone naming

On a valve with two zones — K-28211 and K-28212 — you can choose how each zone's entities are
grouped and named: **Settings → Devices & services → Kohler Konnect → Configure**. On a
single-zone valve the three choices look the same, so there's nothing to change.

Taking a K-28211 with a showerhead and body sprays on zone 1, and a rainhead and handshower on
zone 2:

| | Zone numbers (default) | Sub-device per zone | Outlet names on controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| Devices | `Anthem Valve` | `Anthem Valve`, plus `Anthem Valve Zone 1` and `Anthem Valve Zone 2` | `Anthem Valve` |
| Outlet switches | `Showerhead 1`, `Rainhead 2` | `Showerhead`, `Rainhead`, each on its zone's device | `Showerhead`, `Rainhead` |
| Temperature and Flow | `Temperature 1`, `Flow 2` | `Temperature`, `Flow`, on each zone's device | `Temperature (Showerhead, Body Sprays)` |
| Whether a zone is running | `Shower Active 1` | `Zone Active`, on each zone's device | `Zone Active (Rainhead, Handshower)` |
| Command word | `Hex 1` | `Hex`, on each zone's device | `Hex (Showerhead, Body Sprays)` |

* **With outlet names on controls**, an outlet switch keeps its zone number only when both
  zones have that fixture (`Showerhead 1`, `Showerhead 2`). A zone whose outlet types the
  valve hasn't reported yet falls back to its number.
* **With a sub-device per zone**, everything that belongs to the whole valve — `Shower on`,
  `Favorite`, `Warmup`, `System Status`, the settings — stays on `Anthem Valve`. Give each zone
  device its own area if the zones are in different places.
* **Changing the choice renames entities but keeps their entity IDs**, so automations and
  dashboards keep working. Home Assistant reloads the integration to apply it. Switching away
  from sub-devices moves every entity back onto `Anthem Valve`, including disabled ones, and
  removes the zone devices.

### Anthem valve

| Entity | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Water Used Today` | sensor | Water used since local midnight, from **Kohler's own per-day usage series** — the same data behind the Konnect app's chart. Refreshed after a shower ends (never on a polling clock) and resets to `0.0` at local midnight |
| `Water Used This Week` | sensor | The last seven days including today, as a rolling window — **not a calendar week**. Summed from seven daily buckets; `per_day` carries the breakdown |
| `Water Used This Month` | sensor | This calendar month's usage, from **Kohler's own history** and kept current after each shower via the daily usage series. Reads `0.0` on the 1st until the month's first shower. Carries every month returned as a `history` attribute |
| `Water Used This Year` | sensor | Calendar year to date (`Jan 1` – today), matching the Konnect app's **Year** tab. Each month uses Kohler's monthly history or the daily series, whichever is higher, so every shower updates the yearly total with no extra API calls and a month that has just ended keeps its full total. Reads `0.0` on January 1 until the year's first shower |

| `Shower on` | switch | Turns the shower on or off. On runs **the valve's own default shower** — its first preset, which the Konnect app keeps hidden — so the outlets, temperature and flow it starts are stored on the valve, not here. Off closes every outlet in both zones |
| `Rainhead`, `Showerhead`, `Handshower`, `Tub Filler`, `Body Sprays`, `Foot Sprays`… | switch | One per outlet, named after the fixture the valve reports. See **Outlet names** below |
| `Temperature` | number | Setpoint for that zone, in your account's unit — the Konnect app's slider: **Cold**, then 59 °F up to the valve's current `Max Temperature`. The bottom step (58 °F / 14 °C) is **Cold**: the valve stops mixing in hot water, as the app's `COLD` stop does, and the `cold` attribute reads true. `Temperature 1` / `Temperature 2` on a two-zone valve |
| `Flow` | number | Flow as a percentage, bounded by the limits the valve itself reports. `Flow 1` / `Flow 2` on a two-zone valve. See **Flow** below |
| `Favorite` | select | Presets **stored on the valve**, added in the Konnect app or at the first-generation touchscreen |
| `Experience` | select | The valve's stored **experiences** (Wake Up, Cool Down…), added in the Konnect app. Started with the same command the app uses — new in this release and not yet tried on hardware; see [Favorites and presets](#favorites-and-presets) |
| `Warmup` | select | Off / All Outlets / Started Outlets. See [Warmup](#warmup) |
| `System Status` | sensor | `Water Running`, `Paused`, `Warming Up`, `Idle`. Whole-valve: warm-up and pause are system-level, not per-zone. Carries `seconds_remaining` — how long before the valve's run-time limit closes the water |
| `System State` | sensor | The valve's own `normalOperation` / `showerInProgress` flag — a second opinion to `System Status`, decoded differently. Also `error` and `FirmwareUpdate`, which the Konnect app acts on but no install has yet been seen to send |
| `Shower Active 1`, `Shower Active 2` | binary sensor | Whether that zone is running water. **Two-zone valves only** — with one zone `System Status` answers the same question and more. `Zone Active` with the other [naming choices](#multi-zone-naming) |
| `At Temperature` | binary sensor | Whether the water has reached its setpoint |
| `Problem` | binary sensor | Whether the valve reports a fault — the error flag in its status word, or a `System State` of `error` |
| `Firmware Status`, `Gateway Firmware Status` | update | Whether a firmware update is available for the valve and its Wi-Fi gateway, with installed and latest versions, checked twice a day. **Read-only** — install updates in the Konnect app, which guards against installing mid-shower. The version numbers alone are the `Interface Firmware`, `Valve Firmware` and `Gateway Firmware` diagnostic sensors |
| `Restart` | button | Reboots the valve, as the app's *Restart Product* does. **Disabled by default** — a button can't ask "are you sure?", so enable it on purpose. Stops any running water; can't revive a valve that has dropped off the cloud |

`Water Used Today`, `This Month` and `This Year` each start a new period in Home Assistant's
long-term statistics at local midnight, on the 1st and on January 1. The drop back to zero is
recorded as a new period, not as negative water use.

#### The three settings the Konnect app also has

Configuration entities — they report what the valve holds **and change it**.

| Entity | Kind | Range |
|---|---|---|
| `Max Temperature` | number | 🚨 The **scald limit**, 92-118 °F — the app's own range |
| `Default Temperature` | number | Where a shower starts, 59-118 °F. Setting it **above the valve's current `Max Temperature` fails** with a message naming both numbers — a shower cannot start hotter than the scald limit. The limit in force is published as `scald_limit` |
| `Max Shower Duration` | select | 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 45 / 60 minutes — the app's six options, not a free range |

**Every change is verified.** The valve's endpoint replaces one outlet's whole record with no
list form, so a change is one call per outlet, chained — a `201` from that endpoint means
*accepted for delivery*, never *applied*. The entity responds at once, but the integration
re-reads the valve about 30 s later to confirm what actually landed; if some outlets took the
new value and others didn't, a **repair notice** appears under Settings naming the setting and
the outlets still holding the old value. `Max Shower Duration` carries `outlets_agree` —
`false` means a write like that was lost part-way. Selecting a duration rewrites all outlets.

⚠️ **Konnect 3.0.1 misreads any duration above 30 minutes**, showing it as 25 and writing 1500 s
if you tap Save. Fixed in 3.0.5. Setting 45 or 60 here is safe for the valve and safe in a
current app; only an out-of-date one would quietly undo it.

#### Outlet names

Outlet switches are named after the fixture the valve reports for that outlet, not its
position. The names come from the Konnect app's own outlet list — every type a valve can be
set up with:

| Code | Name | Variant (`outlet_variant` attribute) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Handshower | |
| 11 / 12 | Showerhead / Showerheads | |
| 21 | Tub Filler | |
| 30 | Not Plumbed | |
| 31–39 | Rainhead | Katalyst, Cascade, Kinetic, Rain Curtain, Laminar, Massage (Wave), Hydro Massage, Silk, Real Rain |
| 51 / 52 / 53 | Body Spray / Body Sprays / Body Spray | Single, Multiple, Massage (Wave) |
| 61 / 62 | Foot Spray / Foot Sprays | Single, Multiple |

An outlet whose type the valve hasn't reported yet keeps the positional form, `Outlet 1` or
`Outlet 2.1`. When a name later arrives, the switch is **renamed in place**: each switch is
identified by its zone and position, never its name, so its entity id, history and
automations stay as they were. Zone numbers and repeated fixtures follow
[How entities are named](#how-entities-are-named).

#### Flow

Each zone has a Flow number, bounded by the minimum and maximum the valve reports for that
zone rather than a fixed range — a valve with flow control disabled at the fixture offers
only the value it will honour, and says so in `flow_control_available`.

While the shower is off it shows the last flow Home Assistant wrote, defaulting to 100 %,
**not** the valve's idle flow byte — that byte can hold a calibrated ceiling rather than a
chosen setting while idle. While water is running the valve's own byte is authoritative,
including a change made at the panel mid-shower. `flow_is_live` says which of the two you are
reading.

> ⚠️ **A first-generation Anthem touchscreen may overwrite this.** Opening that panel's flow
> control has been captured rewriting *both* zones before any adjustment was made. If yours
> behaves that way, disable the entity — the protocol layer is unaffected either way.

### Anthem+ controller

| Entity | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Shower` | switch | Starts or stops the shower via the controller, opening **the controller's own default outlets** — a separate setting from the valve's |
| `System` | switch | The controller's overall system state |
| `Favorite` | select | Favorites **stored on the controller**, added in the Konnect app or at the Anthem+ touchscreen. A different list from the valve's |
| `System Status` | sensor | `Water Running`, `Warming Up`, `Idle` |
| `Temperature` | sensor | Read-only; the controller offers no live temperature control. `Temperature 1` / `Temperature 2` on a two-zone system |
| `Zone N Outlet M` | binary sensor | Read-only outlet state as the controller sees it |
| `Steam` | switch | Starts or stops the steam generator at **the controller's own default temperature and time**, as the app's *Steam start* card does. Refused while the controller is running the shower — the app won't run both at once. Only on controllers with steam attached. New in this release and not yet tried on hardware |
| `Experience` | select | The controller's experiences — shower, steam and ice-shower programs such as Breathe, Focus or Detox — started and shown running. They run from zone 1's first outlet, as the app notes |
| `Music` / `Light` / `Steam` | binary sensor | Accessory state. `Light` carries each light group's own state; `Steam` carries temperature, timers and `power_clean` (the generator's self-clean) |
| `Problem` | binary sensor | A fault the controller reports, an active error (its title and code are attributes), or an accessory that is set up but has stopped responding — "Steam is disconnected", an SD card missing — the cases the app shows as error cards |
| `Max Shower Duration` | sensor | The controller's own limit on a shower, in minutes. The shorter of this and the valve's `Max Shower Duration` ends a shower — see [Shower time limits](#shower-time-limits) |
| `Firmware Status` | update | Whether a controller firmware update is available, with installed and latest versions, checked twice a day. Read-only |

The controller's device page also has a **Visit** link to its own web settings page — where its
Max Shower Duration and other settings are changed — using the network address Kohler's
cloud reports for it. New in this release and not yet tried on a real controller: if the
address isn't reported, there's simply no link. Signing in to that page turns the valve's
warmup off; `Warmup Auto-Restore`, if it's on, puts it back.

<details>
<summary><b>Diagnostic entities</b> — mostly disabled by default, for protocol work rather than daily use</summary>

<br>

| Entity | Device | Enabled | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MQTT Connection` | both | no | Whether the push stream is connected — **our** link to Kohler |
| `Cloud Connection` | valve | yes | Whether **Kohler's cloud** can reach the valve. A different question, and the one behind "the app says my valve is offline" — see [When the valve drops off the cloud](#when-the-valve-drops-off-the-cloud) |
| `Last Update` | both | no | Timestamp of the most recent message |
| `Report Log` | both | yes | Switch; one-file bug-report capture of the raw MQTT stream — see [Diagnostics](#diagnostics) |
| `Start new MQTT capture` | the first valve, or the first controller on an account without one | yes | Button; starts a fresh file for the raw MQTT capture, which is off unless switched on — see [Captures and journals](#captures-and-journals) |
| `Hex` | valve | no | The current command word for that zone — copy it into `send_valve_hex`. `Hex 1` / `Hex 2` on a two-zone valve; see [Multi-zone naming](#multi-zone-naming) |
| `Preset Active` | valve | yes | Whether a stored preset is driving the valve |
| `Interface Firmware` | valve | no | The touchscreen's own version — what the Konnect app calls the interface firmware |
| `Valve Firmware` | valve | no | The valve's own version |
| `Second Valve Firmware` | valve | no | The second valve body's version, on two-zone valves only — each zone has its own |
| `Gateway Firmware` | valve | no | The gateway's version. Per-account rather than per-valve, but published on each valve's device |
| `Registered` | valve | no | When Kohler's cloud created this device's record — a registration date, not an installation date |
| `Warmup Auto-Restore` | valve | no | Switch; puts warmup back when something silently disables it. **Only on accounts that also have an Anthem Plus controller.** Off by default. See [Warmup auto-restore](#warmup-auto-restore) |

</details>

### Each device has its own defaults and its own favorites

On a system with both shower products this catches people out: the valve and the controller are not
two views of one set of settings. Each stores its own, and they can differ.

**Default outlets.** Press the dial on the first-generation touchscreen and the **valve's**
default outlets open. Press the dial on the Anthem+ screen and the **controller's** defaults
open. These are separate settings, so the same gesture on two screens in the same room can
start two different showers. The `Shower on` switch on the valve, and `Shower` on
the controller, each do exactly what that device's dial does.

**Favorites.** Both lists can be built either in the Konnect app or at the matching
touchscreen, but they are stored in different places — valve favorites live on the valve,
controller favorites live on the controller. So the two screens show **different lists**,
and so do the two `Favorite` dropdowns in Home Assistant. Only the controller's can carry
lighting, music or steam, because only the controller knows those exist.

### Sensate faucet

Each faucet is its own device. Entity IDs follow the faucet's Konnect name; the examples are
for a faucet named **Kitchen**. Faucet entity names are translated into your language, unlike
the showers'.

| Entity | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Water` | switch | Turns the water on or off. Water turned on here turns off by itself after the [water safety limit](#water-safety-limit). Like the Konnect app, it won't turn the water on while the handle is closed or firmware is downloading; turning it off always works |
| `Status` | sensor | `on` or `off`: whether water is flowing, however it started — by hand, hands-free, a dispense or Home Assistant |
| `Dispense 250 mL`, `Dispense 1 cup`… | button | Seven one-tap amounts: 50 mL to 3 L on a metric account, ¼ cup to 1 gallon on a US one |
| `Dispense amount` | number | How much `Dispense set amount` pours: 10–11360 mL, or 0.5–384 fl oz (3 gallons). Listed under **Configuration** |
| `Dispense set amount` | button | Pours the `Dispense amount` |
| `Preset` | select | Which preset saved in the Konnect app `Dispense preset` pours. Appears once the faucet has a preset. Listed under **Configuration** |
| `Dispense preset` | button | Pours the chosen `Preset` |
| `Dispensing` | binary sensor | A measured amount is pouring — from Home Assistant, or a preset run from the Konnect app. `preset` attribute when it is one |
| `Leak` | binary sensor | Kohler reports a leak that hasn't been cleared — live from the stream's leak alert, and from the faucet's leak history. See [Leak alerts](#leak-alerts) |
| `Clear leak alert` | button | Marks the current leaks as dealt with, which turns `Leak` off |
| `Last dispensed` | sensor | The most recent amount dispensed, in mL or fl oz. Every dispense from Home Assistant counts; one started elsewhere counts only when the faucet's reported state carries its amount, which it doesn't always |
| `Water used today` | sensor | As the valve's `Water Used Today`, from the faucet's own usage history |
| `Water used this week` | sensor | The last seven days including today |
| `Water used this month` | sensor | This calendar month, the larger of Kohler's monthly figure and the daily total |
| `Water used this year` | sensor | Calendar year to date |
| `Firmware status` | update | Whether Kohler has newer firmware for the faucet, checked twice a day and after an install. **Read-only** — install from the Konnect app. Shows a firmware download in progress |
| `Handle` | sensor | Diagnostic. The manual handle's position: `open` or `closed` |
| `Connected` | binary sensor | Diagnostic. Whether Kohler's cloud can reach the faucet; `last_connected` attribute |
| `Firmware download` | sensor | Diagnostic, disabled by default. Kohler's `progress` field, which follows a firmware download, not the water |

While `Connected` is off, the entities that show or control the live faucet are
unavailable; the leak, usage, firmware and settings entities stay available.

`Dispense amount` and `Preset` are settings for their buttons, so the device page lists them
under **Configuration** and Home Assistant's auto-generated dashboard leaves them out. To keep
each next to its button, add a card:

```yaml
type: entities

## Using both together

### What is the combined system?

**First generation — Kohler Digital Anthem.** A digital valve plus a touchscreen interface.
The valve is the whole product: it has the Wi-Fi, it talks to Kohler's cloud, and the Konnect
app drives it from there.

> ⚠️ **The first-generation touchscreen is not a smart device.** It is an HID with a screen —
> **no Wi-Fi, no Bluetooth, no radio of any kind.** This is the single most common
> misconception about the system. The part with Wi-Fi is the valve.
>
> The useful consequence: **once set up, the touchscreen is optional.** With the valve on
> Wi-Fi and showing in Konnect, you can run a shower entirely from your phone. It is *not*
> optional for getting there — see [Common questions](#common-questions).

**Second generation — Anthem+.** Kohler added things the first-generation touchscreen had no
room for:

- **Coordinating two valve bodies** as one system — a product capability; *this integration
  is built for a single valve*, see [Known limitations](#known-limitations)
- **Zigbee hub for lighting** — the radio is there and Kohler lists Sengled Element bulbs as
  supported, but no bulb has been paired successfully with this integration; see
  [Known limitations](#known-limitations)
- **Music**, which needs a separate **Kohler amplifier, K-30319** — it is not built into the
  controller
- **Steam**, via Kohler's steam generator

That is more than a touchscreen can host, so Anthem+ is really **a second-generation
touchscreen attached to a Linux system controller** — a separate box that every accessory
plugs into. The controller then plugs into *the same first-generation digital valve*, and
gets its own page in the Konnect app.

**The combined system.** Because the valve is unchanged between generations and the Anthem+
controller is essentially a smarter interface for it, both can be attached at once — the
valve has two ports:

```
Kohler Konnect cloud
│
├─ Digital valve ...................... Wi-Fi   ← the only part with a radio
│  ├─ port 1 → 1st-gen touchscreen ............. HID only: no Wi-Fi, no Bluetooth
│  └─ port 2 → Anthem+ system controller ──┐
│                                          │  same box, two roles
└─ Anthem+ system controller .......... Wi-Fi ──┘  (its own Konnect page)
   ├─ Anthem+ touchscreen
   ├─ amplifier (K-30319) ............. music, sold separately
   ├─ Zigbee radio .................... lighting
   └─ steam generator
```

The system controller appears twice on purpose: it is a **client of the valve** on port 2,
and a **cloud device in its own right** over Wi-Fi — the whole explanation for why two things
can drive one shower, and why this integration presents two Home Assistant devices for what
is almost always **one physical shower reached through two touchscreens.** They stay separate
devices anyway: they behave differently and their state arrives on different schedules, so
merging them would imply a consistency that does not exist.

### ⚠️ Names that exist on both devices

The most common mistake in a combined setup is grabbing the wrong one. These names appear
on both devices:

| Name | On the valve | On the controller |
|---|---|---|
| `Shower on` / `Shower` | switch — runs **the valve's own default shower** | switch — opens **the controller's own default outlets**, a separate setting |
| `Favorite` | select — presets **stored on the valve** | select — favorites **stored on the controller**; a different list |
| `Experience` | select — experiences added to the valve in the app | select — the controller's own catalogue |
| `System Status` | sensor — `Water Running` / `Paused` / `Warming Up` / `Idle` | sensor — `Water Running` / `Warming Up` / `Idle` |
| `Temperature` (`Temperature 1`, `Temperature 2`) | **number** — the setpoint, writable | **sensor** — read-only |
| `Max Shower Duration` | **select** — writable | **sensor** — read-only; changed on its web settings page |
| `Problem`, `Firmware Status` | the valve's own | the controller's own |

The device prefix is what separates them — `switch.anthem_valve_shower_on` against
`switch.anthem_plus_shower`. Note that `Temperature` and `Max Shower Duration` differ in
*type*, not just in device: if an entity you expected to set turns out to be read-only, you
have the controller's copy. The outlets don't share names: the valve's switches are named
after their fixtures (`Rainhead 1`), the controller's read-only copies by position
(`Zone 1 Outlet 1`).

> The valve's `Favorite` and the controller's `Favorite` are **different lists**. Valve
> presets are stored on the valve; controller favorites are scenes configured in the Konnect
> app, and only the latter can carry lighting, music or steam.

### Which device to reach for

| You want | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A specific outlet, temperature or flow | **valve** | It takes a raw command word — any outlet, any temperature, any time |
| A whole scene, with lights/music/steam | **controller** | It activates named favorites only; whole scenes or nothing |
| To know whether water is actually running | **valve** | Its `System Status` (and `Shower Active 1` / `2` on a two-zone valve) follows the water however the shower was started — either touchscreen, the app, or Home Assistant |
| To act only on a controller-driven shower, or on `Music` / `Light` / `Steam` | **controller** | No valve equivalent exists for these |

A useful rule for automations: if it would still make sense with the controller unplugged, it
belongs on the valve. You cannot ask the controller for "outlet 2 at 39 °C", and the valve
knows nothing about music or lighting — that split is the whole reason both devices exist.

### Common questions

**Will running both break my shower?** No. The valve treats each port as a source of
commands; nothing about having two attached puts it in a state it does not already handle.
Kohler support will tell you not to combine them — the reasons appear to be practical
(support burden) rather than technical, but treat the combination as unsupported: it works,
and it is what this integration was built against, but firmware updates carry no guarantee.

**Can I use both touchscreens at the same time?** Yes. Each screen talks to whatever it is
plugged into and is drawn by that same thing (1st-gen screen ↔ valve; Anthem+ screen ↔
system controller ↔ valve). A touch becomes a command; the state that comes back tells the
screen what to draw, effectively instantly. The controller's screen holds a picture the valve
cannot — lighting, music, steam, a second valve body — but for water the two agree, because
the controller's own view of the valve comes from the valve. What the controller can't do is
see round the valve: if the valve is driven from the first-generation screen, the controller
finds out the same way this integration does, so it can legitimately show `Idle` while the
valve runs water, and both are telling the truth about their own question.

**Do I need a first-generation touchscreen too?** Only to get the valve onto Wi-Fi in the
first place. **The valve only raises its Wi-Fi access point — the one you join to hand it
your network and register it in Konnect — when told to from the first-generation
touchscreen.** There is no app-side, button, or web route to it, and plugging an Anthem+
touchscreen straight into the valve does nothing (it is not a first-generation screen and the
valve does not answer it). So a first-generation screen is required *at least once*; after
that it can be unplugged and the valve stays connected. If you're upgrading from first
generation, keep one of your existing screens rather than discarding it — that's what turns
the install into the combined system.

## Services

### `kohler_konnect.custom_shower`

Starts the shower with the outlets and temperature you choose, sent to the valve as **one
command**. This is the form to use whenever an automation opens an outlet *and* sets a
temperature: the valve cannot take two commands back to back (see
[Known limitations](#known-limitations)), and this sends one.

In the automation editor, add an action, search for **Custom shower**, turn on the outlets,
set the temperature, and optionally turn on **No pausing warm-up (beta)**. The same
thing in YAML:

```yaml
action: kohler_konnect.custom_shower
data:
  device_id: 1a2b3c…          # only with more than one valve: the valve device's id
  zone1_temperature: 108      # in your account's unit; 59–118 °F
  zone1_outlet_1: true        # outlets you leave out are closed
  keep_on_after_warmup: true  # optional and beta, see below
```

Every field the action takes, with what each one does when you leave it out:

```yaml
action: kohler_konnect.custom_shower
data:
  # Zone 1 — the only required field is the temperature
  zone1_temperature: 108      # required; your account's unit, 59–118 °F or 15–48 °C
  zone1_outlet_1: true        # default false — an outlet you leave out is closed
  zone1_outlet_2: false
  zone1_outlet_3: false

  # Zone 2 — omit the whole zone on a single-zone valve
  zone2_temperature: 104      # default: follows zone1_temperature
  zone2_outlet_1: false
  zone2_outlet_2: false
  zone2_outlet_3: false

  keep_on_after_warmup: true  # default false; beta, see below
  flow: 100                   # default 100; 8–100 % of full flow
```

Every key is flat — the **Zone 1**, **Zone 2** and **Advanced** headings you see in the editor
are display only and never appear in the YAML. Outlets your valve does not have are hidden from
the form, and turning one on in hand-written YAML is an error rather than a silent no-op.

What it does:

* **It states the whole shower.** Every outlet you leave off is closed, on both zones.
  Leaving every outlet off stops the shower. Nothing is taken from what the valve last
  reported, which is exactly what makes it safe to fire from a button.
* **Temperature is per zone**, like the valve's own setpoints and the temperature entities.
  Zone 2's is optional: left unset, it follows zone 1's.
* **It fires once.** A second command during the valve's warm-up hijacks the warm-up onto the
  outlets you wrote, so this action never sends a second command on its own.
* **Flow** is under *Advanced* and defaults to full flow, like every other command from Home
  Assistant. The flow you set holds only until someone presses the flow button on the
  touchscreen, which takes over from then on.
* **No pausing warm-up (beta).** Keeps the shower on after the valve's warm-up is finished.
  Only matters when the valve's warm-up is enabled. On such a valve every outlet command first
  runs the warm-up, and when the water is warm the valve **pauses** for two minutes, just as it
  always does — left alone, that pause ends the session. With this on, the integration watches
  the valve's own reports and, when that pause arrives, sends your outlets and temperature
  again, once. It does nothing if no warm-up follows (warm-up disabled, or the water was
  already warm), if the warm-up ends in a stop rather than a pause, or if someone takes over at
  the wall. **Beta:** tested on one valve so far — please report how it behaves on yours.

The temperature range is the zone slider's without its **Cold** step: typing `0` is refused
rather than giving you a cold shower. Use the slider's bottom step, or `send_valve_hex`, for
full cold.

The response carries the two command words it sent, so the action doubles as a way to learn
the word for `send_valve_hex` below.

> ⚠️ **This can start water.** It writes directly to the valve.

### `kohler_konnect.send_valve_hex`

Sends a command word straight to the valve, for anything the normal controls cannot do. If
what you want is outlets plus a temperature, use `custom_shower` above; this one is for the
rest.

The workflow is copy-and-paste rather than hand-assembly. Set the shower up the way you want
it using the outlet switches and temperature controls, read the resulting code off the
`Hex` diagnostic sensor (`Hex 1` / `Hex 2` on a two-zone valve), and store that string. Sending it later reproduces that exact
state.

```yaml
action: kohler_konnect.send_valve_hex
data:
  device_id: 1a2b3c…         # only with more than one valve: the valve device's id
  zone1_hex: "0184C801"      # zone 1, 38.8 °C, flow 0xC8 (200) = 100 %, outlet 1
  zone2_hex: "1184C801"      # optional; omitted entirely on a single-zone valve
```

Both fields accept 8 or 16 hex characters. On a single-zone valve the Zone 2 field is hidden
from the UI form automatically. See [`gcs/valve_hex.md`](gcs/valve_hex.md) for the full byte
layout.

> ⚠️ **This can start water.** It writes directly to the valve with none of the guards the
> switches apply.

### `kohler_konnect.dispense`

Pours a measured amount of water, or a preset saved in the Konnect app, from a faucet. Every
dispense must be between 10 mL and 11.36 L (3 gallons, the most the Konnect app pours).

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `amount` | Yes\* | How much to dispense, in `unit` |
| `unit` | No | `ml`, `l`, `fl_oz`, `cup`, `qt` or `gal`. Defaults to `ml`, or `fl_oz` when your Konnect account uses US units |
| `preset` | Yes\* | A preset's name, as the `Preset` dropdown lists it (`One Cup (2)` for a second "One Cup"). Case doesn't matter |
| `device_id` | No\*\* | The faucet, or faucets, to pour from |

\* Exactly one of `amount` or `preset`. An unknown preset is refused with a list of the
faucet's presets, and nothing is poured; with several faucets, each must have it.
\*\* Required when the account has more than one faucet. The action won't guess and run water
at every faucet.

```yaml
action: kohler_konnect.dispense
data:
  amount: 2
  unit: cup
```

```yaml
action: kohler_konnect.dispense
data:
  preset: A Glass of Water
```

## Features in detail

### Favorites and presets

The valve stores presets; the controller stores named favorites. Both are exposed as
`select` entities, and both are configured in the Konnect app rather than here — this
integration activates them, it doesn't create them.

**Experiences** are Kohler's built-in programs — on the valve, ones you've added in the app
(Wake Up, Cool Down, the ice-shower routines); on the controller, its fixed catalogue of
shower, steam and ice-shower programs. Each device has its own `Experience` dropdown. The
valve's starts with the same command the Konnect app sends, but earlier versions of this
integration believed the valve ignored it, and nobody has yet confirmed it on hardware — if
choosing one does nothing, the dropdown falls back to `Off` after a few seconds. Please open an
issue either way.

### Warmup

Kohler's pre-heat feature: run water until it reaches temperature, so the shower is ready
when you step in. The dropdown offers the three modes the app can actually write —
**Off**, **All Outlets**, **Started Outlets**. The last is the app's *Selected outlets*,
renamed here for what it does.

> **"All Outlets" skips a tub filler** (measured): a warm-up that ran the tub filler would
> fill the tub, so the valve leaves that outlet closed and warms through the others.

The protocol defines two additional delayed-start modes. Those remain decodable because a
valve can be holding one, but nothing defines their delay and they are refused as write
targets. If your valve is holding one, it appears in the dropdown while it is in force and
disappears once you change it.

> Which outlets "Started Outlets" refers to is **not readable from the cloud API.** That
> lives in per-zone configuration on the controller's local API.

### Warmup auto-restore

Off by default. Turn it on if your warmup mode keeps turning itself off.

⚠️ **This is a fix for a hub problem.** If your account has no Anthem Plus controller — valves
only — the known cause below cannot occur, and this switch defends against nothing. Leave it
off unless you actually observe the mode reverting.

On a hub-attached installation, warmup can revert to **Off** with no visible cause at the
valve. The identified cause: ordinary signed-in use of the Anthem Plus controller's local web
UI silently writes the valve's warmup mode to disabled — a PIN sign-in alone is enough — as a
fixed part of its login routine, from the *hub's* firmware. It cannot be prevented from
outside that firmware, so this switch is the mitigation: it sets the mode back sixty seconds
after a disable this integration did not cause, and writes a journal entry with a window of
MQTT traffic either side.

It is deliberately cautious: it will not undo a disable this integration performed itself, it
will not fire on a restatement after a reboot, it stops after five restores that fail to
stick, it never writes while water is running, and it does nothing unless it has previously
seen the mode enabled.

### Shower time limits

The valve turns the water off once a zone has run for its **Max Shower Duration** — 15, 20,
25, 30, 45 or 60 minutes, set with the valve's `Max Shower Duration` dropdown or in the
Konnect app. The timer runs per zone and keeps counting when you switch between outlets in
that zone.

Two other limits can end a shower sooner:

* **An Anthem Plus controller** has its own Max Shower Duration, set on its web settings page
  and shown by the controller's `Max Shower Duration` sensor. The shorter of the two wins.
* **A favorite** stored on the valve carries its own run time. When it is shorter, it ends a
  shower started from that favorite.

While water runs, `System Status` (and `Shower Active` on a two-zone valve) shows
`flowing_for_seconds` and `seconds_remaining` until the valve's limit.

### Captures and journals

Separately from the Report Log (see [Diagnostics](#diagnostics)), the integration can write
development-style evidence to `/config/kohler_konnect_raw/`. **Both are off by default.**

| File | What it holds | Turned on by |
|---|---|---|
| `mqtt_raw_*.jsonl` | Every MQTT message, exactly as received | `logger.set_level` with `custom_components.kohler_konnect.konnect.raw_log: debug`, until restart |
| `warmup_*.jsonl` | Warmup mode changes, with traffic windows either side | `logger.set_level` with `custom_components.kohler_konnect.konnect.journal: debug`, until restart |

Those logger levels act as switches: nothing is written to Home Assistant's own log, and
setting the level back to `info` stops the capture. Each file is capped at 8 MB and rolls
over to a new one rather than pruning. The `Start new MQTT capture` button opens a fresh
raw capture file, which is useful before a deliberate experiment.

## Faucet features

### Water safety limit

Water turned on with the `Water` switch turns off by itself after a set time — 10 minutes
unless changed in **Configure** — unless something turns it off first, or the faucet is seen
running and then off. `0` turns the limit off. The deadline survives a restart or reload, and
if the off command fails it is retried every minute. Dispenses end by themselves and are not
limited.

### Konnect presets

Presets are made in the Konnect app; the `Preset` dropdown lists them in the app's order, and
`Dispense preset` pours the chosen one with the ordinary dispense command and the preset's
amount. The choice is kept by preset, not by name, so renaming one in the app keeps it chosen;
deleting it falls back to the first. Presets are read from the faucet's own list — the one the
app's faucet screen shows — with the account-wide list as a stand-in.

### Leak alerts

`Leak` turns on the moment the stream delivers Kohler's real-time leak alert, and also from
the faucet's leak history, which is re-read every 5 minutes. Kohler keeps that history and has
no "clear" of its own, so `Clear leak alert` marks the current leaks as dealt with here; a new
one turns `Leak` back on. Cleared leaks are remembered across restarts.

### When a faucet refuses

As the Konnect app does, a faucet refuses to start water while its **handle is closed** ("Open
the handle to dispense water remotely") or while it is **downloading firmware**; turning water
off always works. Kohler can also refuse a command itself — with the faucet offline, or with
code 906, "water could not be dispensed". Each comes back as a message saying which.

## Requirements

* Home Assistant **2026.3** or later
* A Kohler Konnect account, with your devices already set up in the Konnect app
* **Internet access.** Control is cloud-only for every product. If Kohler's cloud is
  unreachable, nothing here can turn water on or off.

The only Python dependency is `paho-mqtt`, installed automatically.

## Install

This integration is **not in HACS's default store.** Add it as a custom repository.

### Via HACS

1. In HACS, open the ⋮ menu and choose **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/kedube/ha-kohler-konnect`, category **Integration**
3. Find **Kohler Konnect** in HACS and install it
4. Restart Home Assistant

> HACS installs from **releases**, not from the latest commit.

### Manually

Copy the `custom_components/kohler_konnect/` folder from this repository into the
`custom_components/` folder of your Home Assistant configuration directory, so that
`config/custom_components/kohler_konnect/manifest.json` exists, and restart Home
Assistant.

## Setup

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Kohler Konnect**

1. **Sign in** with your Konnect username and password. Credentials are exchanged for a token;
   the password is not stored. Every supported device on the account is added.
2. **Confirm your valve model**, if the account has a valve or a controller. The integration
   detects the outlet split from your account and skips the question when it can, so this
   is usually nothing at all. An account with only faucets is never asked.

Temperature and water units are read from your Konnect account, not chosen here — set them in
the Konnect app and they follow. That includes the faucets' dispense units: US cups, quarts
and fl oz on a `Standard` account, millilitres and litres on a metric one.

**Configure** on the integration card has two settings, each shown only on an account where
it applies: how a two-zone valve's entities are named and grouped — see
[Multi-zone naming](#multi-zone-naming) — and the faucets'
[water safety limit](#water-safety-limit). Every other setting that can change after setup is
an entity on the device page (`Warmup`, `Max Shower Duration` and — where an Anthem Plus
controller is present — `Warmup Auto-Restore`), where automations and dashboards can reach it
too.

### Diagnostics

Every device page and the integration card have a **Download diagnostics** button, producing
one redacted JSON report of the whole installation. For raw traffic, see
[`mqtt/capture_runbook.md`](mqtt/capture_runbook.md) for the full walkthrough.

In short: turn on the **Report Log** switch on a valve or controller page to capture a
bug-report-sized file under `custom_components/kohler_konnect/reports/` — it records every
MQTT message on the account, faucets' included. For REST requests, set
`custom_components.kohler_konnect.konnect.client` to `debug` with `logger.set_level` and they
appear in Home Assistant's own log. For a raw MQTT capture across a longer stretch, see
[Captures and journals](#captures-and-journals). All of them redact credentials but not device
ids — skim a file before attaching it to an issue.

## Upgrading from Kohler Anthem or Kohler Sensate

Kohler Konnect replaces both under a new name (`kohler_konnect`), so it is added as a new
integration; nothing carries over by itself. Until the old entries are removed, a card in
**Settings → Repairs** names them — their entities duplicate this integration's, and each
keeps a connection of its own to Kohler.

1. Note what refers to the old entities — automations, scripts, dashboards, the Energy
   dashboard.
2. Delete the old entries in **Settings → Devices & services**, remove the old integrations
   in HACS, and restart.
3. Install Kohler Konnect and add your account.

Deleting first matters: entity ids come from device and entity names, so on a cleared
registry most return exactly as they were, and history follows the entity id. The exceptions
are entities Kohler Anthem renamed while keeping their old ids, which come back under the
current name: `switch.anthem_valve_shower` (named `Shower` before 0.6.5) becomes
`switch.anthem_valve_shower_on`, `sensor.anthem_valve_status` and `sensor.anthem_plus_status`
(before 0.19.0) become `…_system_status`, and `update.anthem_valve_firmware` (before 0.28)
becomes `update.anthem_valve_firmware_status`, as do the gateway's and the controller's. What
else changes:

* The actions are `kohler_konnect.custom_shower`, `kohler_konnect.send_valve_hex` and
  `kohler_konnect.dispense`; `dispense` takes `amount` and `unit`, not `amount_ml` or
  `amount_l`.
* A faucet has `Water used today`, `this week`, `this month` and `this year`, like a valve,
  in place of its lifetime `Total water used`. Point the Energy dashboard at
  `Water used today`.
* Faucet units follow the Konnect account; the metric/imperial option is gone.
* A faucet's update entity is `Firmware status`, as the showers' are.
* Faucet settings — the water safety limit — are one setting for the account, in
  **Configure**.

## Automation examples

**Notify when the shower is up to temperature**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Shower ready
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.anthem_valve_at_temperature
        to: "on"
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: Shower is at temperature.
```

**Start a favorite from anywhere**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Morning shower
    triggers:
      - trigger: time
        at: "06:30:00"
    actions:
      - action: select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: select.anthem_plus_favorite
        data:
          option: Morning
```

**Open an outlet and set its temperature, from one button**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Rain head at 108
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: input_button.rain_head
    actions:
      - action: kohler_konnect.custom_shower
        data:
          zone1_temperature: 108
          zone1_outlet_1: true
          keep_on_after_warmup: true   # beta; only matters with the valve's warm-up on
```

One action, one command to the valve. In the UI editor this is the **Custom shower** action
with zone 1 outlet 1 on and the zone 1 temperature set; no YAML needed. Use `custom_shower`
rather than an outlet switch followed by a temperature change — see
[Known limitations](#known-limitations) for why two valve commands back to back can undo each
other ([issue #1](https://github.com/kedube/ha-kohler-konnect/issues/1)).

The raw equivalent is `send_valve_hex` with a hand-built word:

```yaml
      - action: kohler_konnect.send_valve_hex
        data:
          zone1_hex: "01A6C801"   # 0x1A6 (422) = 42.2 °C = 108 °F, flow 100%, outlet 1
```

Zone 2 is re-sent as it stands when `zone2_hex` is omitted. Build the word from the *Hex*
diagnostic sensor: change the last byte for outlets (`01`, `02`, `04`, and sums), and the
temperature per the [hex reference](gcs/valve_hex.md) — or read it off `custom_shower`'s
response.

**Pre-heat when you leave work**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Warm the shower on the way home
    triggers:
      - trigger: zone
        entity_id: person.me
        zone: zone.work
        event: leave
    actions:
      - action: select.select_option
        target:
          entity_id: select.anthem_valve_warmup
        data:
          option: All Outlets
```

**Alert if the push stream drops** — this is about *your* connection to Kohler.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Anthem push stream lost
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.anthem_valve_mqtt_connection
        to: "off"
        for: "00:05:00"
    actions:
      - action: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          message: Lost the push connection to the Anthem valve.
```

**Alert if the valve drops off Kohler's cloud** — a different fault, and the one that needs
you to go and unplug something.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Anthem valve offline
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.anthem_valve_cloud_connection
        to: "off"
    actions:
      - action: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          message: >-
            Kohler cannot reach the Anthem valve. The shower still works at the wall.
            Power-cycle the valve to bring it back.
```

⚠️ **Do not trigger on `unknown`.** That state means the check has not run yet — usually just
after a restart — not that anything is wrong.

**Fill the pasta pot by voice** — a script, exposed to Assist, Google or Alexa:

```yaml
script:
  fill_pasta_pot:
    alias: Fill the pasta pot
    sequence:
      - action: kohler_konnect.dispense
        data:
          amount: 4
          unit: qt
```

**Notify on a faucet leak** — press `Clear leak alert` once it's dealt with, so the next leak
triggers this again.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Kitchen faucet leak
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_leak
        to: "on"
    actions:
      - action: notify.notify
        data:
          message: The kitchen faucet reported a leak.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Entities are unavailable, or state is stale.** Check the `MQTT Connection` diagnostic binary
sensor on a valve or controller — it is disabled by default, so enable it from the device page
first. On an account with only faucets, the diagnostics download shows the same. Control is
cloud-only, so an internet outage or a Kohler-side problem takes everything with it. The integration reconnects and reseeds from REST on its own.

### When the valve drops off the cloud

**The Konnect app says the valve is offline, but Home Assistant looks fine.** These are
different faults and it is worth knowing which you have. `MQTT Connection` reports *our* link
to Kohler; the valve can vanish from Kohler's side while that stays green, and then every valve
entity simply freezes at its last value with nothing to say so.

`Cloud Connection` on the Anthem Valve device is the answer to that. It reports what Kohler's
cloud believes about the valve: **on**, **off**, or **unknown** (not yet checked — a failed
check leaves the previous answer alone rather than inventing an outage; look at the
`last_error` attribute). It is enabled and visible by default.

**It is not polled.** The integration asks Kohler only when there is a reason to:

* the controller reports a zone running while the valve says nothing for a minute — the
  signature of a valve that is working at the wall but gone from the cloud; or
* the valve has said nothing at all for three hours.

At most one check every thirty minutes either way. The `checked_because` and `last_checked`
attributes say which reason fired and when.

**If it says off:** the valve is still working from its own touchscreen — this is a cloud
problem, not a plumbing one. Nothing in Home Assistant can bring it back; the valve needs to be
power-cycled at the outlet. Once it is back, its first message makes the integration ask
Kohler again — at most one check every thirty minutes still applies — and `Cloud Connection`
turns on with no further action.

**Home Assistant keeps asking me to sign in again.** Kohler's identity provider rotates the
refresh token on every use. If another tool is refreshing the same grant, it invalidates the
copy Home Assistant holds. Give this integration its own sign-in.

**The Warmup dropdown has an option I didn't expect.** Your valve is holding one of the two
legacy delayed-start modes. It's shown so Home Assistant can display the true state, and it
disappears once you select something else. You can't select it.

**The shower stops after about fifteen minutes.** That's the configured maximum run time, and
it's working as designed. Raise the valve's `Max Shower Duration` (up to 60 minutes). With an
Anthem Plus controller, raise the controller's own Max Shower Duration too — the shorter one
wins. See [Shower time limits](#shower-time-limits).

**Zone 2 entities are missing.** Expected on a single-zone valve — K-28209 and K-28210 have
one zone.

**Temperature is in the wrong unit.** It follows your Konnect account. Change it in the
Konnect app.

**A faucet refuses to dispense.** Check its `Handle` sensor: a closed handle blocks remote
water, as it does in the app. Also check `Connected`, and whether `Firmware status` shows a
download in progress. See [When a faucet refuses](#when-a-faucet-refuses).

**A faucet's changes take up to 30 seconds to appear.** The stream has not yet delivered a
message about that faucet — until it has, polling carries it. Use the faucet once, from the
app or by hand, and it speeds up. If it keeps reverting, the diagnostics' `instant_updates`
counts say how often the stream missed a change.

## Known limitations

* **Cloud-only.** No local control path exists for any of these products. The controller's local API
  can read configuration but cannot actuate anything.
* **Flow can be overwritten on some hardware.** Each zone has a Flow number. But a
  first-generation Anthem touchscreen has been captured rewriting *both* zones' flow the
  moment its flow panel is opened — before any adjustment is made — applying its own linked
  scaling and a calibration-derived ceiling. On such an install a setpoint written from Home
  Assistant can change on its own; disable the entity if yours behaves that way. The protocol
  layer is unaffected either way.
* **Music and lighting are read-only; steam runs only its defaults.** The controller exposes
  music and lighting as state, and steam's only direct command runs the controller's default
  program; anything else means activating a favorite that includes it. The Konnect app has
  no other command for any of them — this is the limit of what **Konnect** exposes, not what
  the hardware can do.
* **New controls are app-confirmed, not hardware-confirmed.** The `Steam` switch, both
  `Experience` dropdowns and the valve's `Restart` button send exactly what the Konnect app
  sends, but none has been run against hardware by this integration yet.
* **Which controller fronts which valve is not knowable.** Nothing on the cloud side says
  it, so on an account with more than one valve or more than one controller the valve's
  `System Status` no longer folds in a controller-initiated warm-up — it reads the valve alone and
  reports `controller_warmup: null`. With exactly one of each they are assumed to be the
  same shower, as before.
* **One valve body.** Anthem+ can coordinate two; this integration was written against a
  single-valve system and does not handle a second. Open an issue if you have a two-valve
  system.
* **Lighting is unproven.** Anthem+ has a Zigbee radio and Kohler lists Sengled Element bulbs
  as supported, but no Sengled bulb has been tried against this integration; the one attempt
  used a Philips Hue bulb and it did not pair.
* **Warmup's selected outlets can't be read** from the cloud API.
* **One valve command at a time.** The valve reports a command back about a second after
  accepting it, and the next command is built from that report. Two valve commands inside that
  second undo each other — the second one closes what the first opened. With the valve's warm-up
  off, a `delay:` of about 3 s between valve actions (outlet switches, temperature, the Shower
  switch, favorites) is enough. With warm-up on, no delay makes a two-step automation work — a
  command during the warm-up hijacks it onto the outlets you wrote, and one after the warm-up's
  pause ends the session — so send everything in one command: the `custom_shower` action, or a
  single `send_valve_hex` word. The failure mode is water off, never water on.
* **Little hardware tested.** See below.
* **Faucet commands use a different sign-in than before.** The separate faucet integration
  signed in with Kohler's password (ROPC) policy, which Kohler accepts for faucet commands.
  This one signs in once for the whole account with the `B2C_1A_signin` policy the showers
  need — the same one the Konnect app uses for its faucet commands, but not yet run against a
  faucet by this integration.
* **The faucet's `SET` sibling is untested.** It is handled as the app handles it, exactly
  like the Sensate.
* **The API is undocumented** and Kohler can change it without notice.

## Tested against

**Three installations' worth of hardware.** A K-28212 — 6 outlets, 3 + 3 across two zones —
with an Anthem Plus controller on firmware 2.88, which most of the shower findings in this
guide come from; two K-28210 valves; and a Sensate faucet on firmware 16.0, which the faucet
findings come from.

Other models and configurations are supported on the basis of what the protocol says, not on
the basis of anyone having run them. If you have different hardware, reports are genuinely
useful — particularly from a single-zone valve, or from a valve without a controller in front
of it.

Issue reports from **different hardware** are the most useful thing anyone can contribute — a
single-zone valve, a four-outlet valve, or a valve with no controller in front of it would
each test paths that have never run outside their own source code. If you're reporting a
problem, [Download diagnostics](#diagnostics) plus the Report Log are what make it
diagnosable — check them for anything you'd rather not share before attaching them.
