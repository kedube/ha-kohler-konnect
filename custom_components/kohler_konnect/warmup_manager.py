"""Warm-up mode: writing it, watching it, and putting it back.

Warm-up is a **stored mode**, not an action — an enabled mode means the valve warms the
water by itself at the start of a session — and it is the one setting on this integration
that something else routinely takes away. The hub's web UI writes `warmUpDisabled` on any
signed-in use of it, the Konnect app can, and the fixture itself can. Auto-restore exists
to notice that and undo it, which needs more machinery than a setting normally does: a
memory of the last enabled mode, a record of our own writes so we do not restore over
ourselves, a delay-and-recheck before writing, a counter that gives up rather than fight
forever, and a journal of the whole thing because the cause is still an open question.

That is thirteen methods and six pieces of state, which lived on
:class:`~.coordinator.Valve` until 0.10.0 and made up a fifth of it. They are here now
because they form a closed system: everything that touches the warm-up mode is in this
file, and the rest of `Valve` reaches it through a few members — chiefly
:attr:`auto_restore`, :attr:`last_mode`, :meth:`async_set_warmup` and
:meth:`handle_mode_change`.

**The valve keeps its public surface unchanged.** `valve.warmup_auto_restore`,
`valve.last_warmup_mode` and `valve.async_set_warmup(...)` still work and still mean the
same thing — they delegate here. Entities, services and diagnostics were not touched by
the move, and neither were their unique ids.

The pure decision logic — *should* this disable be restored, and to what — is not here
either: it is in :mod:`.konnect.warmup`, with no I/O and no Home Assistant, so it can
be tested against captured sequences. This module is the part with the side effects.
