"""Consumer-side raw MQTT capture, keyed to a switch — the "Report Log".

# =====================================================================
# REPORT LOG — off by default, one file per switch-on, survives restarts
# =====================================================================

**Why this exists beside `raw_log.py`, which also captures raw MQTT.** The two serve
different people and different moments:

* `raw_log.py` is the *development* evidence machine: pinned on via `const.py` during
  protocol work, one file per Home Assistant run, written to `/config/kohler_konnect_raw/`
  beside the cutoff and warmup journals it interleaves with.
* This one is the *user's* capture: a switch on the device page ("Report Log") that someone
  flips on to document a bug — or a healthy run — and off when done, producing **one file
  per episode** they can attach to a GitHub issue.

The episode is the unit, not the Home Assistant run:

* **Switch on → a new file**, named for the moment it was enabled.
* **Home Assistant restarting does not split the episode** — the coordinator persists the
  episode name in the config entry options and re-attaches to the *same* file in append
  mode after the restart. A capture of "it breaks when I restart HA" must not lose the
  interesting part to the restart itself.
* **Switch off → the episode ends.** The next switch-on starts a fresh file.

Record format is `raw_log.format_record` — byte-compatible with the development capture, so
every existing tool reads both.

Size is bounded per file, not per episode: a file that reaches ``max_bytes`` rolls to a
continuation part (``<episode>_p2.jsonl``, ``_p3``, …) sharing the episode stem, so one
runaway episode cannot eat the disk in a single unmanageable file and a restart's re-attach
lands on the latest part.

⚠️ **The directory lives inside the integration folder** (``custom_components/
kohler_konnect/reports/``) — the owner's choice, so reports sit with the integration
they describe. Two consequences, both accepted: a HACS update or reinstall **replaces the
integration folder and deletes any reports still in it** (move files out before updating if
they matter), and on the development install the directory is gitignored.

Thread safety: paho calls `write()` on its network thread; `start`/`resume`/`stop` run in
an executor. The lock covers all file state, same pattern as `raw_log.py`.

Kohler Konnect — report captures
====================================

Each report_*.jsonl file here is one capture episode of the raw Kohler MQTT
stream, recorded because the "Report Log" switch on the device page was on.
One file per switch-on; a Home Assistant restart continues the same file; a
file that reaches {max_mb} MB continues in _p2, _p3, ... parts.

One JSON object per line:

    ts           ISO-8601 UTC, when the message arrived
    topic        the MQTT topic
    payload      the payload text exactly as received (undecoded)
    payload_b64  present INSTEAD of payload when the bytes were not UTF-8
    qos, retain  from the MQTT message

Attach these files to a GitHub issue to document a bug — or a healthy run on
hardware the integration has never been verified against.

⚠️ Before sharing, know that these files contain your device identifiers and
show when your shower was used. Review anything you'd rather not publish.

⚠️ This folder is inside the integration itself, so updating or reinstalling
the integration DELETES it. Move files you want to keep somewhere else first.

Turning the switch off ends the capture; the files stay until you delete them
(or an update does).
