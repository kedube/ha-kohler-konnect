"""Raw MQTT capture — every payload paho hands us, before any decoding.

# =====================================================================
# RAW MQTT LOGGING — diagnostic, OFF BY DEFAULT, safe to delete wholesale
# =====================================================================
#
# Searching for this later? The markers are:
#
#   grep -rn "RAW MQTT LOG" custom_components/kohler_konnect/
#
# That finds this module, the two constants in `const.py`, the call site in
# `mqtt.py:_on_message`, and the wiring in `coordinator.py`. Removing all four
# blocks removes the feature completely.
#
# =====================================================================

This exists because the decoded `Envelope` is lossy by design — it keeps `sku`, `deviceid`,
`code` and `attributes`, and drops everything else. When the question is "what did Kohler
*actually* send", a decoded stream cannot answer it, and the answer is unrecoverable after
the fact. This replaces the capture that used to live in the separate `mqtt_capture.py`
bridge, which stopped being reachable when the old `kohler` integration was removed.

**What is written is the payload exactly as it arrived** — the undecoded UTF-8 text, not a
re-serialised dict. A payload that is not valid JSON, or not valid UTF-8, is still captured;
those are precisely the ones worth having, and the normal decode path silently drops them.

Two ways to switch it on, both without touching this file:

* **From the Home Assistant UI, no restart** — Developer Tools → Actions →
  `logger.set_level`, in YAML mode. The whole `data:` block is a mapping of logger name to
  level; there is no `entity_id`, because a logger is not an entity.

      action: logger.set_level
      data:
        custom_components.kohler_konnect.konnect.raw_log: debug

  Setting it back to `info` stops the capture and closes the file on the next message. This
  is the one to reach for. Note `logger.set_level` is per-logger — the system-wide one is
  `logger.set_default_level`, which does **not** turn this on (see :attr:`RawMqttLog.enabled`).
  Neither survives a restart, which is the right default for a capture.

* **Permanently, across restarts** — set `ENABLE_RAW_MQTT_LOG = True` in `const.py`.

Nothing is created on disk until the first message actually arrives while enabled, so
leaving the feature installed but off costs one branch per message.

Thread safety: paho calls `write()` on its own network thread, never the event loop, so the
file I/O here is already off-loop. The lock guards against a `close()` from the loop racing
a write from that thread.
