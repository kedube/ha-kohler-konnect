"""Server-side Azure AD B2C sign-in for Kohler Konnect.

Kohler's B2C app registration only accepts a **custom-scheme** redirect URI
(``msauth.com.kohler.hermoth://auth``) — there is no localhost or web redirect, so the
usual "let the browser come back to us" OAuth dance is impossible. The previous approach
sent the user to the sign-in page in a browser and asked them to copy the final
``msauth://...?code=...`` URL back; modern browsers drop that navigation without ever
showing the URL, which made it unusable.

This module avoids the problem entirely by driving the B2C custom policy the way the
sign-in page's own JavaScript does, in-process:

1. ``GET /authorize`` with PKCE — collects session cookies plus the ``csrf`` token and
   ``transId`` from the page's ``SETTINGS`` blob.
2. ``POST /SelfAsserted`` with the username and password — returns a small JSON status.
3. ``GET /api/CombinedSigninAndSignup/confirmed`` **without following redirects** — B2C
   answers ``302 Location: msauth.com.kohler.hermoth://auth/?code=...``.
4. ``POST /token`` — exchanges that code, with the PKCE verifier, for tokens.

Step 3 is the whole trick: the unresolvable custom scheme is only ever a string in a
response header we read ourselves. No browser is involved, so nothing can block it, and
the user just types an email and password.

Verified live 2026-08-11: the redirect URI is accepted and strictly validated, step 2
returns ``AADB2C90053`` for bad credentials, and step 3 returns the expected 302.

        last, which may be the loser's.

        and the window is widest at startup and immediately after each expiry — exactly
        when they fire together.

        the ordinary case, finds the winner's fresh token and makes no request at all.
