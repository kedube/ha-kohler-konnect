"""A JSONL debug journal written beside the raw MQTT capture. Off by default.

One writer, parameterised by file prefix and README, so a journal is a few lines to add.
Today it serves one: the **warmup journal** (`warmup_*.jsonl`), which records every change
to the valve's warmup mode with the traffic around it — see `WARMUP_README` below. Until
2026-10-08 it also wrote the run-time cutoff decision log for Endless Shower, which has
been removed.

Records stamp `ts` as ISO-8601 UTC with a `Z` suffix, the same clock and format as
`mqtt_raw_*.jsonl` in the same directory, so the two interleave by sorting on it.

Switching it on:

* **Permanently** — the journal's `ENABLE_*` constant in `const.py`
  (`ENABLE_WARMUP_DEBUG_LOG`).
* **From the UI, no restart** — Developer Tools → Actions → `logger.set_level`:

      action: logger.set_level
      data:
        custom_components.kohler_konnect.konnect.journal: debug

Volume is a handful of lines per shower. Files are one per Home Assistant run, each capped
at `max_bytes`, and pruned to the newest `keep_files`.

Thread safety: callers run on the event loop, but `note()` is cheap and the lock makes it
safe from the paho thread too, matching `RawMqttLog`.

Kohler Anthem — warmup journal
==================================

These `warmup_*.jsonl` files were built to answer what was once this project's oldest open
question: **what keeps setting the Anthem valve's warmup mode back to `warmUpDisabled`?**

SOLVED, 2026-08-21 — it is the Anthem Plus hub's web UI. Ordinary signed-in use of it (a
PIN sign-in alone is enough; so is an SD-card music scan) runs a fixed routine that writes
the valve's warmup mode, and the value written is `warmUpDisabled` every time — a constant
in the hub's login/UI routine, not a stored setting: no hub surface, local or cloud, holds
the literal, and `get_valve_settings.warmupmode` read `on` during the very logins that
pushed the disable. Reproduced live six times in one day (four UI actions, three with
deliberately empty 120 s before-windows, plus two PIN-probe logins); auto-restore recovered
every one in 63-69 s. The durable record with both evidence tables is `docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md`
§3h.

The journal stays on as the watchdog: it is what proved the mechanism, it verifies every
auto-restore end to end, and it is what would first notice a second, different writer.

{keep_desc}

Records
-------
  baseline          the first line of every file: the mode in force when the journal opened,
                    read over REST at setup, plus whether auto-restore is armed and what it
                    would restore to. The valve never volunteers its mode on connect — over
                    all 74 raw captures the first `GCS_WARM_STS` in a file lands between
                    137 s and 7 h in — so without this line a file has no idea what it
                    started from, and cannot say how long the mode had been in force.
  mode              the mode moved. `before` -> `after`, `ours` (did we write it), and
                    `source`: `mqtt` if the valve announced it, `rest` if a reseed found it
                    already changed. A `rest` one means the move happened while the stream
                    was down, so it can never carry a `before_window` — but since 2026-08-22
                    it carries `restoring` and a discovered disable is restored through the
                    same machinery as an announced one (a hub sign-in during an outage was
                    the hole). Journals before that date carry `restored: false` here
                    instead: recorded, deliberately never restored.
  announced         the valve restated a mode it was already in. Carries `mode` and `ours`.
                    No decision attached — 28 of the 43 announcements in the raw corpus are
                    these. ⚠️ **Check `ours` before reading one as the valve volunteering.**
                    Setting the mode from the dropdown lands here rather than on a `mode`
                    record: the write reads itself back over REST immediately, so our state
                    has already moved by the time the valve's echo arrives ~3.4 s later.
  disabled          the mode went to `warmUpDisabled`. Carries `ours` (did we write it),
                    `restoring` (is auto-restore acting), and `before_window`: every MQTT
                    message seen in the {before}s leading up to it.
  context           written {after}s later, holding `after_window` — the messages that
                    followed. `SYSTEM_STS: SYSTEM_READY` appearing here is the signature seen
                    7-9 s after two of the four known disables. The window deliberately
                    closes before auto-restore could act, so this record never contains our
                    own write.
  restore*          what auto-restore did: scheduled, skipped, done, or failed.

Reading them
------------
Every record has an ISO-8601 UTC `ts`, the same clock as the raw capture beside it, so the two
interleave:

    jq -c '{{ts, src:"warmup", event, mode, before, after, ours}}' warmup_*.jsonl > /tmp/a.jsonl
    jq -c '{{ts, src:"raw", topic}}' mqtt_raw_*.jsonl > /tmp/b.jsonl
    sort -m /tmp/a.jsonl /tmp/b.jsonl

What a hub-UI disable looks like
--------------------------------
The machine fingerprint, constant to the tenth of a second across eight days of instances:
the `disabled` record, then the hub's five-snapshot burst at +2.6-3.2 s, then
`READ_GCS_EXPERIENCE_STS` at +4.7-5.0 s. The write itself never appears on this MQTT
channel — only the valve's echo does. A `disabled` record WITHOUT that follower pattern
would be news: a different writer than the one identified.

⚠️ Absence of a message means "nothing was pushed", never "nothing happened" — MQTT here is
the Konnect app's UI channel, not device-to-device traffic.

Auto-restore and this journal
-----------------------------
A single disable is recorded identically whether the Warmup Auto-Restore switch is on or off:
both windows close before a restore could fire. The disable cannot be prevented from outside
the hub's firmware, so **auto-restore on is the standing mitigation** — every hub web UI
sign-in will disable warmup, and the restore puts it back a minute later. Our own writes stay
identifiable in the records (`ours: true`, and the `restore*` events carry timestamps).


Turning it off

Set ENABLE_WARMUP_DEBUG_LOG = False in const.py and restart Home Assistant Core.
