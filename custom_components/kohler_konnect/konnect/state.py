"""Device state assembled from the MQTT stream and REST snapshots.

Each device type keeps its own state object. They are fed from two directions:

* ``apply_envelope()`` for live MQTT updates, and
* ``apply_rest_state()`` once at startup, because MQTT is event-driven and says nothing
  until the shower next changes. Without a seed read, a restart leaves every entity unknown
  until somebody touches the shower.

Both are pure data — no Home Assistant imports — so they can be exercised offline against
captured payloads.

        ⚠️ **This message carries `id` / `name` / `status` inside its attributes, and never
        `favoriteid`.** That key is real, but it belongs to the *accessory* messages —
        `MUSIC_STS`, `LIGHT_STS` and `STEAM_STS` each carry top-level `favoriteid` and
        `experienceid`. An earlier version of this method read `favoriteid` here, so it
        resolved to `None` on every message, `active_favorite_id` was permanently unset, and
        the controller's Favorite dropdown snapped back to `Off` the moment any other
        message arrived. Corrected 2026-08-21 against a live activation.

        ⚠️ **Nor are those a substitute — they answer a different question.** An accessory's
        `favoriteid` is attribution for *that component*: "the music playing right now was
        started by favorite 2". Whether favorite 2 is still running is not the same thing,
        because **a favorite is a composite and its components are optional** — it bundles
        `water`, `steam`, `music` and `light`, and carries only what the owner put in it and
        what the hub is wired to. So:

        * A favorite with no music never appears in `MUSIC_STS` at all. Four of this
          account's six favorites carry no music; watching `favoriteid` would report nothing
          running while the shower is on.
        * Attribution drops before the favorite does. Measured 2026-08-21, `MUSIC_STS` went
          to `favoriteid: "0"` at 07:23:59.150Z, **0.6 s before** `FAVORITE_STS` reported the
          favorite itself `OFF` at 07:23:59.766Z.

        `FAVORITE_STS` is the one message that speaks for the favorite. See
        `docs/protocol/hub_controller.md` §1 for the component table and the three different ways an
        absent component is spelled.

        **`status` matters as much as `id`.** Start and stop carry the *same* id and differ
        only in `status`, so keying on the id alone would latch the dropdown on forever::

            {"id": "1", "name": "Hair Wash", "status": "ON"}    <- activated
            {"id": "1", "name": "Hair Wash", "status": "OFF"}   <- stopped, 96 s later

        A missing `status` is treated as ON, the same direction of error as `_name_of` and
        the `isExperience` filter in `select.py`: prefer showing a favorite over hiding one.

        The name travels with the message, which is why it is kept — it lets the dropdown
        show a running favorite before the favorites list has been seeded.
