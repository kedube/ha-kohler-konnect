"""Commands for the Anthem digital valve (SKU ``GCS``).

The GCS valve is addressed directly and has **no "run my default"** — every start must
specify the complete valve state as a hex command word. There is no bare on/off command,
which is the fundamental difference from the Anthem Plus HUB.

All direct writes go through ``solowritesystem``. Presets are a stored layer on top:
``controlpresetorexperience`` with ``{preset, action}`` starts one by itself — the valve
runs the stored scene, no valve write follows. (An earlier reading held that it only
*selected* a preset and a start needed two commands; live testing disproved that, and the
two-command path was removed 2026-08-21.)

        🚨 **Three ways to silently corrupt a safety setting**, all documented in
        `docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md` §2.1 and all guarded here:

        * **Omitting a key.** Gson drops unmatched keys, the API returns 201, and the field
          takes whatever the server defaults to. A record with an unknown field cannot be
          written at all — that is what the `None` check below refuses.
        * **The write keys are not the read keys.** `maximumRuntime`, `maximumFlowrate`,
          `minimumFlowrate`, `defaultFlowrate` — lowercase `t`/`r` on the write side,
          capitalised on the MQTT read side. Four of twelve fields would vanish.
        * **The wrong scale.** The body wants wire units: tenths of °C and flow bytes. REST
          reports display units, which is why `OutletLimits` normalises on the way in and
          this sends what it holds without converting again.

        A 201 means *accepted for delivery*, never *applied* — the response carries no echo
        and the app performs no read-back. Callers must verify by reading the value back,
        and must allow time: an immediate `gcsadvancestate` read still shows the old value.

        Warmup is a **mode toggle**, not a run-now command — there is no separate start and
        stop. The mode *is* the on/off state, and once enabled the valve runs it by itself.

        The four fields below are the whole request model
        (``AnthemWriteWarmUpRequestModel``): there is no duration, no delay, no outlet list
        and no temperature. Re-confirmed against Konnect Android 3.0.1 on 2026-08-20 and
        3.0.6 on 2026-10-07.

        ⚠️ **``warmUp`` is required, and omitting it fails silently** — Kohler's cloud
        returns 200 and the device ignores the request. That is the single most common bug in
        implementations of this call, because the published curl examples show a three-field
        body; the upstream ``kohler-anthem`` library has it. Hence the guard: a caller that
        cannot name a mode must not reach the API at all, because the failure it would get
        back is indistinguishable from success.

        The app blocks this while the system is active, so set it when idle — see
        ``KohlerKonnectCoordinator.async_set_warmup``, which mirrors that guard.

        ⚠️ **Turning warmup off means writing ``warmUpDisabled`` here.** It is *not* posting
        ``presetOrExperienceId: 0`` to ``controlpresetorexperience``, which is what
        ``kohler-anthem``'s ``stop_warmup`` does: that clears a running preset and leaves the
        warmup mode exactly as it was — a different field on a different endpoint.

        ``mode`` is validated by the caller, not here. ``WARMUP_MODES_CURRENT`` in
        ``const.py`` holds the three the current app offers; the two legacy delayed-start
        values are decodable but should not be written. See ``docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md`` §5.
