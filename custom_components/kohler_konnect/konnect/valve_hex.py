"""Encode and decode the Anthem GCS 4-byte valve command word.

Single source of truth for the valve word. This replaces three implementations that
previously had to agree by hand: a Jinja encoder in ``scripts.yaml``, a decoder in the
standalone ``mqtt_capture.py``, and a subtly wrong ``ValveMode`` reading in the
``kohler-anthem`` library.

Layout, identical for reads and writes::

     0 1 | 2 3 | 4 5 | 6 7
      01 | 84  | C8  | 07
      ^     ^     ^     ^
      |     |     |     └─ outlet mask
      |     |     └─────── flow
      |     └───────────── temperature
      └─────────────────── prefix

Only the first 8 of the field's 16 hex characters carry the command; the trailing 8 were
``00000001`` in every captured message.

Every constant here is validated against 315 ``GCS_SOLO_STS`` messages correlated with the
HUB's ``SHOWER_VALVE_STS``. ``docs/gcs/valve_hex.md`` is the byte-by-byte reference, and
``docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md`` §3.2 has what the app adds to it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `h.z()` maps a displayed whole °F to tenths of a °C directly, and it is **not**
# `round((f - 32) * 50 / 9)`. Above 86 °F it sits exactly one tenth *below* that formula at
# sixteen entries — 87, 89, 91, 93, 96, 98, 100, 102, 105, 107, 109, 111, 114, 116, 118, 120 —
# precisely the set where naive rounding would round up.
#
# **That low bias is the mechanism, not a rounding artefact.** It is what makes the app's
# round trip idempotent: with `h.j(c) = round(c * 1.8 + 32)` for display, `z(j(t)) == t` holds
# for all 64 entries. Naive arithmetic breaks it on 12 of the 34 values this integration's
# slider can produce, every one by +1 tenth:
#
#     102 °F -> ours 0x185 (389), Kohler 0x184 (388)
#     100 °F -> ours 0x17A (378), Kohler 0x179 (377)
#      98 °F -> ours 0x16F (367), Kohler 0x16E (366)
#
# Measured consequence, 2026-08-17: the owner reported the temperature coming back "one more"
# after the shower restarted itself, and 0x185 (389) appears 11 times in this system's capture
# corpus. `z()` cannot produce it, and the Celsius path writes whole degrees (380/390/400), so
# **no Kohler client emits it in a direct write** — which is what makes this table right for
# `solowritesystem`.
#
# ⚠️ **Correction, 2026-10-07 (Konnect 3.0.6): the app does emit 389 — in favorites.** Its
# favorite path converts a °F default temperature arithmetically, `(F - 32) * 0.5555`
# formatted to one decimal (`db0/c.java` `J()`), so a favorite saved at 102 °F stores 38.9 °C
# = 0x185, and a running favorite's temperature is what the valve word then reports. Those
# 11 captured words could therefore be favorites as much as this integration's writes; the
# earlier note calling 389 "a value no Kohler client can emit" was wrong. The conclusion for
# direct writes stands. See `PRESET_ECHO_MAX_TENTHS` for the one place this changes code.
#
# The valve accepts off-ladder values perfectly well — nothing here is a protocol requirement.
# What it costs is that a setpoint written from Home Assistant no longer sits where the
# touchscreen would put it, so the next panel adjustment starts from a value one tenth off.
#
# Outside 59–122 °F the app returns 0, which for a device that opens water valves would mean
# "full cold". `unit_to_celsius` falls back to the arithmetic rather than doing that.

#   percent         0-100       HUB favorite `flowrate` and HA entities, byte / 2
#
# Verified live: with the shower idle, gcs-state reports flowSetpoint "50" on both valves,
# and 50 * 4 = 0xC8 = the maximum flow byte. The outlet configuration's documented
# "flow 16-200" range is in BYTE units (0x10-0xC8), not either of the other two.
#
# The HUB has no independent flow of its own — its favorite `flowrate` is just read and
# written through to the GCS valve, so the valve is always the real source.
# **Confirmed 2026-09-10 against the owner's two valves**: every one of their six outlets
# reports `maximumFlowRate: 200`, so `byte / 2` is exactly right on this hardware, and the
# live words decode to the percentages the diagnostics show (byte 49 -> 24.5 %, byte 53 ->
# 26.5 %). The reference integration hardcodes the same 2 and additionally truncates with
# `byte // 2`, losing the half-percent on the odd bytes both of these valves actually carry.
#
# **Only a default, since 0.8.2.** Percent is a ratio against the outlet's own
# `maximumFlowRate` — see `flow_byte_to_percent` below — and the Flow entity uses this zone's
# real ceiling. This constant remains for callers with no per-outlet context (`decode_word`
# and `encode_word` have 28 call sites and no per-valve context), where it reproduces exactly

# `READ_GCS_OUTLET_CONFIG_CFG`, and across every capture the byte has never once fallen
# outside 16-200 (31 distinct values). So the usable percent range is 8-100, not 0-100.
#
# **The valve honours a directly written flow byte.** Verified against hardware: 74 and 100
# commanded with one, two, and three outlets open in a zone, every echo matching exactly, and
# the other zone untouched.
#
# That needs saying because touchscreen-driven captures look nothing like this — the byte
# moves on its own when outlets change, and the same outlet set tops out at 200 in one
# session and 69 in another. That is the **touchscreen** computing linked-zone scaling and
# its own ceiling before it sends; the valve just obeys whoever wrote last. The Konnect app
# is a third actor and has removed flow control entirely. Writing directly, none of the
# touchscreen's behaviour applies to us.
#
# Consequence for a client: encode against [16, 200] and expect it to stick — but keep
# treating the echo as truth, since the touchscreen can overwrite at any time.
#
# The byte is continuous over that range, which is why it is frequently **not** a multiple
# of 4: values like 17, 19, and 165 are ordinary. `flowSetpoint` (byte/4, the 0-50 figure
