"""Azure IoT Hub status stream for every Kohler Konnect device on an account.

Kohler pushes device status as IoT Hub **direct methods**, all of them on one account-level
topic. A single connection therefore carries every device on the account — valves,
controllers and faucets alike — and callers filter by ``sku`` and ``device_id``.

Three behaviours drive the design, each learned the hard way:

* **Hold the connection, and reuse the identity.** A connect-per-command client receives
  nothing, ever. The identity is registered once and persisted by the caller rather than
  generated per connect, which previously left a dead registration behind on every restart.
  A *newly* registered identity may not receive for a short while; a reused one is already
  provisioned. See :attr:`KonnectMqttStream.warming_up` for how thin that evidence is.
* **One topic.** Only ``$iothub/methods/POST/#`` delivers. Device-scoped topics are
  acknowledged and stay silent.
* **Acknowledgement.** Direct methods must be answered on
  ``$iothub/methods/res/200/?$rid=N`` or the service will consider them unhandled.

The transport is paho-mqtt, which runs its own network thread. Callbacks are marshalled
onto the owning event loop so consumers never touch that thread.
