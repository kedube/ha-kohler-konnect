# the `logger.set_level` switch (see `raw_log.py`), so a released build with it True
# captures every MQTT payload with no supported way for the owner to stop it short of
# editing the integration's source.
#
# An earlier version of this comment claimed the capture was "bounded (8 MB x 6 files)".

# Preset 1's hidden timer — normalised once at setup
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A GCS preset carries its own `time`, a second run-time limit independent of the outlets'
# `maximumRunTime`. Whichever is lower stops the shower, and nothing ever re-syncs the preset
# to the hardware value: `time` is only ever what the last writer sent. Full protocol detail
# in `docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md`, "two independent timers".
#
# That is a problem for **preset 1 specifically, and only preset 1**, because it is hidden
# from the owner in both the first-generation touchscreen and the Konnect app. Its timer is
# whatever the setup wizard happened to store when the preset was created — on this install,
# 1800 s, frozen at a factory reset on 2026-08-14 and then stranded when `maximumRunTime`
# went to 3600 s. The owner has no interface anywhere that can correct it.
#
# So the integration sets it once, to `DEFAULT_PRESET_TIMER_SECONDS`, and then leaves it
# alone. The intent is not to manage the timer but to take it *out* of the way, so the
# hardware gate is the thing that limits a shower — one limit, in one place, that the owner
# can actually see and change.
#
# **Every other preset is deliberately untouched.** Presets 2-10 are visible and editable in
# the Konnect app, their timers are the owner's choice, and on the first-generation
# touchscreen that timer is also the countdown shown during a run. Normalising those would
# overwrite a deliberate setting and change what the panel displays. Preset 1 is exempt from
# that reasoning precisely because it is the one the owner cannot see.
#
# Why a constant rather than following `maximumRunTime`: the hardware limit cannot be read on
# demand *over MQTT*, which is where this runs: `READ_GCS_OUTLET_CONFIG_CFG` arrives unprompted,
# one outlet at a time, so at setup the value is frequently not known yet. (It **is** readable
# over REST from `gcsadvancestate` — corrected 2026-08-17 — but this sync deliberately does not
# depend on a second network read succeeding.) A fixed target that is at or above every observed hardware value
# leaves the gate to the hardware in every case.
SYNC_DEFAULT_PRESET_TIMER = True
# Preset 1 is "Default shower" on every install seen: created by the setup wizard, and the
# slot the app hides.
DEFAULT_PRESET_ID = 1
# 3600 s is the highest `maximumRunTime` observed on this hardware (900/1800/3600). Setting
# the preset at the ceiling means the outlet limit is always the binding constraint.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What a config-entry change has to be before it is worth a reload
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Read by `_async_update_listener` in `__init__.py`; the mechanism is in
# `konnect/entry_reload.py`, which also explains why the comparison needs a snapshot.
#
# Keys the running integration writes to its OWN entry. A change to one of them is
# bookkeeping, not configuration, and must never cause a reload:
#
# * `CONF_REFRESH_TOKEN` — B2C rotates it on every refresh and invalidates the previous one,
#   so the newest has to be persisted immediately or a restart comes up unauthenticated.
#   That makes it the most frequently written key here, and reloading on it would flap every
#   entity and drop MQTT for nothing.
# * `CONF_MOBILE_DEVICE_ID` — generated once on first connect, then reused forever.
RELOAD_IGNORED_DATA_KEYS = frozenset({CONF_REFRESH_TOKEN, CONF_MOBILE_DEVICE_ID})

# `RELOAD_IGNORED_OPTION_KEYS` is defined further down, after the warmup constants it
# names — see the Warmup auto-restore section.

# REMOVED 2026-08-15 — valve reboot counter, controller ping, outage counter
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `CONF_GCS_REBOOT_COUNT` / `CONF_GCS_REBOOT_LAST` / `CONF_HUB_LOCAL_HOST` /
# `CONF_HUB_OUTAGE_COUNT` / `CONF_HUB_OUTAGE_LAST` / `CONF_HUB_OUTAGE_LAST_SECONDS` /
# `HUB_LOCAL_POLL_SECONDS` all lived here, alongside `konnect/hub_local.py`.
#
# They existed to diagnose the valve reboot fault, and that investigation is closed: the
# cause was a failing Moes smart outlet, not the Kohler hardware. With both devices moved off it, the counters had no
# remaining question to answer — and the probe was the integration's **only** polling loop
# in an otherwise push-only design, at 1 Hz against the controller.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Temperature slider bounds (Home Assistant side only)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What the temperature sliders offer. **These are a UI gate, not a device limit.** The valve
# accepts far more — 0 °C is a real setting meaning "full cold", and the app's own ceiling is
# 48.8 °C — and `valve_hex.py` still encodes the whole range, so a preset, the touchscreen,
# or `send_valve_hex` can still put the valve outside these bounds.
#
# Narrowed to the range people actually shower in, because a slider spanning 32-119 °F makes
# every useful degree a pixel wide.
#
# ⚠️ **The ceiling was 113 °F until 0.12.0, on a premise that turned out to be false.** The
# note here read "113 °F is also exactly the `maximumOutletTemperature` the valve reports for
# every outlet (450 tenths °C)" — true of the reference valve, and generalised from it. It is
# not universal: the owner's two valves report **450 tenths (113 °F) and 477 tenths
# (117.9 °F)**, confirmed 2026-09-10. So the old ceiling silently withheld five degrees the
# hardware would have accepted, on any valve set higher than the one this was written from.
#
# **92-118 °F is exactly what the Konnect app offers for the Max Temperature setting**
# (owner-confirmed 2026-09-10; Konnect 3.0.6 `gc0/i.java` bounds it 33-48 °C, shown as
# 92-118 °F). That is what `Max Temperature` and `Default Temperature` use these for.
#
# ⚠️ **It is not the zone temperature slider's range, which this used to claim.** Konnect
# 3.0.6 bounds that slider from a `COLD` stop one degree below the outlet's minimum (sent
# as 0 °C, full cold) up through `minimumOutletTemperature` (59 °F) to the valve's *current*
# `maximumOutletTemperature` (`qa0/p.java`, `db0/c.java` `n0()`). The zone control follows
# that since 2026-10-07 — owner's decision — using `ZONE_TEMPERATURE_MIN_F` below and the
# valve's live maximum; see `number.ZoneTemperatureNumber`.
#
# The bounds were 80-113 before 0.12.0 — both ends invented here rather than taken from the
# app. The old ceiling was justified as matching `maximumOutletTemperature`, which was a
# double mistake: that value was read from one valve and generalised, and it is a **setting**
# rather than a hardware limit. The owner changed one valve from 113 °F to 118 °F in the app
# on 2026-09-10 and the valve took it. So there is no fixed device ceiling for this slider to
# match — only the app's range, which is what it matches now. `maximumOutletTemperature` is
# still the ceiling in force at any moment, and the `Max Temperature` number shows it.
#
# Stated in Fahrenheit and converted for a Celsius account — the reverse would make these
# unrecognisable to anyone checking them against the shower.
#
# Consequence to keep in mind: if the wall panel sets a temperature below the minimum, the
# entity still *reports* it, but the slider cannot represent it accurately.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Outlet type codes
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The valve reports a type code per outlet in `outLetType`. **This is now the full table** —
# Konnect 3.0.6's own outlet picker (`db0/c.java` `X()`, duplicated in `mc0/n.java`), the
# list a user chooses from when setting a valve up, so every code a valve can hold is one of
# these. Recovered 2026-10-07.
#
# It agrees with every code confirmed on hardware before then — 1, 11 and 21 from Kohler's
# own documentation, 31 on a K-28210 (2026-09-10) and 52 on a K-28211 (2026-10-05) — and it
# names the three seen in captures but never matched to a fixture: **38 is a Silk rainhead,
# 39 a Real Rain rainhead, 62 a pair of foot sprays.** (The 0.5.1 mistake of naming 52 and
# 62 by lining one install's outlet order up against another's is still the thing never to
# do; these come from the app's table, not from inference.)
#
# Names are the fixture as the app titles it. Where the picker distinguishes one fixture from
# several (`Showerhead` / `Showerheads`, `Single` / `Multiple` body or foot sprays), the
# plural is kept, because "Body Sprays" switches more than one head. Rainhead and body-spray
# *variants* (Katalyst, Silk, Massage…) are the same fixture to switch, so they share a name
# and the variant is published separately — see `OUTLET_TYPE_VARIANTS`.
#
# **This is a label, not behaviour.** The valve derives no flow envelope from the type; the
# controller does. Nothing in this integration reads these names to decide anything.
#
# The Konnect app's own outlet names are *not* here because they are not transmitted: no
# name string appears anywhere in the captured API surface, so a rename in the app cannot
# be read back. These are fixture types, which is the closest the hardware gets.
#
# Naming a code renames its switch, at the next setup. The switch's unique id is its
# position, not its name, so it stays the same entity, with the entity id it was first
# registered as — see `entity.outlet_unique_id`.

#
# **This must not be "whatever the valve currently holds".** It used to be, and that quietly
# handed control of every HA write to the touchscreen: opening an outlet from Home Assistant
# re-sent the last flow the wall panel wrote. Measured over 1,346 captured valve words, 419 —
# **31%** — were below 100%, the lowest at **8%**. So roughly a third of the time, turning on
# a shower from Home Assistant would have produced a trickle, with nothing in the UI to
# explain why or to fix it.
#
# 100% is the only defensible default: it is the one value a user who has no flow control
# cannot be surprised by. (This used to add "it is what the Konnect app pins favorites to".

# wording until 2026-08-21, when the owner renamed them: `All Outlets` took a capital O, and
# `Selected outlets` became **`Started Outlets`**, which describes what the mode does here
# rather than echoing the phone. So the dropdown and the app now read differently for that
# mode — deliberately. Only the labels moved; the protocol values, the write path and which
# modes are offered are all unchanged.
#
# The two legacy delayed-start modes get labels too, but they are never *offered* — they are
# only added to the dropdown when the valve is already holding one, so the entity can report
# the truth instead of blanking. Their labels follow the same wording, so the dropdown stays

#
# The problem this exists for: the GCS valve drops off Kohler's cloud on its own and only
# returns on a power cycle. MQTT cannot report it — everything on that stream is published
# *by* the valve, so a disconnect is silence, and silence is indistinguishable from idle.
# Measured over a 19-day corpus: the longest silence provably benign is **12 h 02 m**, and
# the one real outage was **12 h 22 m**. No silence threshold separates them, which is why
# neither of the triggers below alerts on silence — they only decide when to *ask*.

# How close a GCS message has to be to a HUB `SHOWER_VALVE_STS` for the pair to count as
# confirmed. Both directions, so a valve message just before or just after the controller's
# report pairs it.
#
# 60 s, not 5 s. Measured across the 19-day corpus: at ±5 s there are 23 unpaired controller
# reports (3.9 %), nearly all ordinary controller lag; at ±60 s there are **4**, and **3 of
# those are the 2026-08-26 outage**. The controller normally trails the valve by 0.3–2 s, but
# a documented restore once went **176.77 s** with no valve message at all — which is why the
# rule additionally requires a zone to be ON rather than trusting timing alone.

# per half hour is enough to answer "is it gone", since the failure lasts hours and is only
# cleared by a human at the wall.
