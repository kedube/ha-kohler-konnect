"""Service actions for Kohler Konnect.

The faucets' ``dispense`` lives in `faucet/services.py` and is registered from here when the
account has a faucet. The other two are the valve's, both writing it through
``solowritesystem`` — the same endpoint every other control path uses:

* ``custom_shower`` — the form. Tick outlets, pick a temperature, optionally a flow, and it
  goes to the valve as **one** complete command. Added 2026-09-06 after GitHub issue #1 showed
  what every automation built in the UI turns into — an outlet action, then a temperature
  action — and that the valve cannot take two commands back to back: the second is built from
  a report that predates the first, and closes what the first opened. The words sent here come
  from the form and from nothing else; see `konnect.valve_hex.encode_shower`.
* ``send_valve_hex`` — the escape hatch, a raw command word for anything neither the entities
  nor the form can express.

**Only registered when the account has an Anthem valve.** ``solowritesystem`` is a GCS
endpoint — an Anthem Plus controller on its own has no valve to write to, and control there
goes through favorites instead. So on a HUB-only account neither service appears at all,
rather than appearing and failing.

The **device field is optional**. With one Anthem valve on the account — every install
before 2026-09-08 — it can be left empty and the action finds the valve itself; asking
would be friction for nothing. With several, it says which one, and an action that does
not say is refused rather than sent to whichever valve happened to load first.

**These services can run water.** Input is validated before sending and the effect is logged,
but they are deliberately unrestricted otherwise: the point is to reach states the UI does
not model.
