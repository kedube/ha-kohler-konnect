"""Shared entity bases for the showers. Faucet entities have their own, in `faucet/`.

Two kinds of shower device are registered, never merged, because they behave differently
and their state arrives on different schedules:

* **Anthem Valve** — a digital valve. Authoritative for outlets, temperature, and flow.
  An account can have several, each its own device bound to its own
  :class:`~.coordinator.Valve`.
* **Anthem Plus** — a system controller. Owns favorites, music, steam, and lighting. An
  account can have several — one per bathroom — and each is its own device, bound to its
  own :class:`~.coordinator.Controller`.

A valve and a controller are usually the same physical shower reached through two different
touchscreens, but presenting them as one device would imply a consistency that does not
exist.

The SKU strings ``GCS`` and ``HUB`` appear nowhere a user can see them. They exist only in
Kohler's API — not in the app, the manual, or on the hardware — so every user-facing string
uses the names Kohler itself shows: "Anthem" and "Anthem Plus".

    Lives here rather than on the switch because the Max Shower Duration select names each
    outlet the same way in its `per_outlet` attribute, and a select platform reaching into a
    switch platform for it would couple the two for no reason.

    Three rules, in order:

    * **The fixture name wins** where the valve's `outLetType` maps to a confirmed one —
      `Rainhead` says what the entity does in a way `Outlet 1` never can.
    * **The zone suffix follows the grouping mode:**
      - Single-zone valves and `subdevices` mode drop the zone number (`Showerhead`),
        since the device itself scopes the zone.
      - `outlet_labels` mode drops the zone number whenever the fixture type is unique
        across the valve (`Showerhead`, `Body Sprays`, `Rainhead`, `Handshower`),
        keeping it only if both zones carry the same fixture type on the single device.
      - `numbered` mode appends the zone number on multi-zone valves (`Showerhead 1`).
    * **An unknown code falls back to the position** — `Outlet 1` (or `Outlet 1.2` when
      multiple zones share one device). Naming an outlet after a code nobody has
      confirmed would be inventing a fixture; the number is honest.

    Read **once, at construction**. Per-outlet types arrive gradually over MQTT and via the
    REST seed, so a valve that has not announced yet names its outlets by position and picks
    up fixture names on the next restart. Renaming entities live would change their ids
    underneath running automations, which is worse than waiting.
