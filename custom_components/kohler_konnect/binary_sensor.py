"""Binary sensors.

Two unrelated groups live here:

* **Valve diagnostics** — stream health, and per-zone and at-temperature readings. Mostly
  disabled by default; they matter when something is not behaving, not day to day.
* **Controller outlets** — the controller's own view of its outlets, on every controller.
  Where a valve exists the valve's switches remain the answer to "is water running"; these
  answer "does this controller know about it", which is not the same thing.

The controller's view of a session driven through the valve's own API is unreliable —
measured across 95 such episodes: 51 reported immediately, 12 late, 32 never, and
preset-driven openings never (0 of 15). That is why the valve's entities, not these, are
the water state wherever a valve exists. See ``konnect.models.resolve_outlet_source``.

    is gone the controller, the account and this integration are all healthy, so
    ``MQTT Connection`` stays on and every other entity simply freezes.

    ⚠️ **This is not the sensor that was removed in favour of ``MQTT Connection``**, though it
    reports the same REST field. That one polled, and when polling was deleted it had no push
    source and went stale. This one is driven by two push events that decide when to read —
    see `cloud_watch.py` for both, and for why silence alone can never be one of them.

    It was created hidden from 0.2.7 until 0.11.2, on the reasoning that a healthy connection
    is not worth dashboard space. That was the wrong trade: hiding it put "(Hidden)" beside
    the name everywhere the entity appeared, which reads as a broken entity rather than a
    deliberate default, and the one moment it matters — the valve has dropped off Kohler's
    cloud and every other entity has silently frozen — is exactly when nobody wants to go
    unhide something first. It is a connectivity sensor, so it shows as a plain
    Connected/Disconnected row and costs nothing while it says Connected.

      not reach Kohler" and "Kohler cannot reach the valve" are different faults, and the

    It also has a bearing on the run-time cutoff: a cutoff during a preset-driven session
    pauses *every* zone the preset owns, not only the one that expired.

    **Known false negative: a preset started during warm-up.** The valve applies the preset's
    valve word but never sets `presetOrExperienceId`, so this reads OFF while the preset is
    demonstrably in effect — and it does not correct itself when warm-up ends, because
    warm-up ending pauses the valve and ends the session. All 12 `warmUpInProgress` samples
    in the capture corpus carry a preset id of `0`. This is the device's behaviour, not a
    decode problem, and it is reported rather than papered over: guessing "a preset is
    probably running" from a warm-up flag would be inventing state. Pair it with
    `select.anthem_valve_warmup` and the valve word if the distinction matters. Full evidence in `docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md`.
