"""Buttons for the Kohler Konnect integration.

Two: restart a valve (below), and start a new raw MQTT capture file. That exists because the
natural way to get a fresh capture — restart Home Assistant — costs a full reload and drops
the MQTT connection, which nobody wants in the middle of a sequence of shower experiments.

Pressing this rolls the file instead: the current one is closed and a new one opened, so each
experiment lands in its own file rather than being separated by timestamp afterwards.
