"""Coordinator: holds the MQTT stream, the REST client, and per-device state.

One per Kohler account. It owns what every device shares — the sign-in, the REST client and
the one MQTT connection — and the per-device objects: a `Valve` for each Anthem valve, a
`Controller` for each Anthem Plus, and a `FaucetCoordinator` for each Sensate or Setra
faucet, which polls on its own clock (see `faucet/coordinator.py`).

Shower state is **push-only**. MQTT carries every change as it happens and there is no
polling interval at all — REST is read on events, never on a clock, with one exception:
firmware availability, which nothing announces, is checked twice a day.

Three things this has to get right:

* **Cold start.** MQTT is event-driven and silent until the shower next changes, so a
  restart would leave every entity unknown. One REST read at setup seeds everything.
* **Reconnects.** The broker replays nothing on connect: measured across 27 sessions, the
  first message is always a change event and six sessions received nothing for hours. So
  every connect re-seeds, which is what makes dropping the poll safe.
* **Token rotation.** B2C issues a new refresh token on every refresh and invalidates the
  old one. Losing it strands the account, so it is written back to the config entry
  whenever it changes.

        control path uses; the only difference is that the caller supplies the words.

        Both words are validated with ``normalize_word`` before anything is sent. Malformed
        input is rejected locally rather than posted to a device that opens water valves, and
        the decoded meaning is logged so the journal records what was actually asked for.

        ``zone2_hex`` omitted **re-sends zone 2's current state**, so zone 2 keeps doing

        That sentinel means "no valve addressed", and on a two-valve system it is measured to

        gets a well-formed word with mask ``0x00``; only a valve that does not physically
        exist gets the sentinel, which is why a single-zone model still sends it here.

        The protocol has no partial write — every POST carries both zones — so "leave zone 2
        alone" can only be expressed by sending zone 2's own current word, which is what this
