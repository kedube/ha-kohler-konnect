"""Per-zone temperature for the Anthem valve.

One entity per zone, because the valve carries an independent temperature byte for each. A
zone maps to a valve: zone 1 is the primary, zone 2 the secondary. Zone 2 entities only
exist on models that have a second valve.

Setting the value re-sends the complete valve command — the valve accepts no partial write —
preserving whichever outlets are currently open and the current flow. That mirrors the
Konnect app, which POSTs a fresh command on every adjustment, and it means changing the
temperature mid-shower takes effect immediately rather than at the next start.

**Flow is a per-zone control here, restored 2026-09-10.** It was removed on 2026-08-13
because a first-gen Anthem touchscreen was observed rewriting both zones' flow the instant
its flow panel was opened, making a Home Assistant setpoint impossible to rely on. That
finding stands — the capture is in ``docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md`` — but the conclusion drawn from it
was too broad: it came from **one** install, and it was applied to every valve
unconditionally, so owners whose valve honours a written flow byte had no control either.

Restored as a valve entity because flow is the valve's own capability: the codec encodes
and decodes byte 2 in full, ``async_apply_valve`` has always accepted ``zone1_flow`` /
``zone2_flow``, and the valve honours what it is given within its calibrated range. On an
install whose panel does fight it, the entity can be disabled; that is a better failure than
withholding the control from everyone.

The bounds are the valve's **own** reported limits, not a constant — ``zone_flow_limits``
reads the per-outlet minimum and maximum the hardware announces, so a valve with flow
control disabled reports a narrow range rather than being offered one it will not honour.

    **The range is the valve's own.** ``zone_flow_limits`` returns the minimum and maximum
    flow bytes this zone's first outlet reports — the same pair the Konnect app bounds its
    slider with — falling back to the protocol limits (8-100 %) only when the valve has not

    26.5 %, unmoving across hours, while the owner's panel held 100 % on both valves. A
    number that does not move is more convincing than one that flickers, not less, so
    neither is shown as a setpoint.

    A control has to display something, so the entity remembers what it last wrote and
    falls back to `DEFAULT_FLOW_PERCENT` — which is also what `async_apply_valve` sends when
    no flow is specified, so the displayed value and the commanded value agree. Once water

    **The slider goes to 118 °F; the scald limit is enforced on the way in.** An earlier
    version moved `native_max_value` with `Max Temperature`, which was more faithful to the
    app and worse to use: Home Assistant caches an entity's bounds, so the slider's range
    changed shape underneath whoever was looking at it and could show stale limits until the
    next update. Reported by the owner 2026-09-11 as "takes a long time to update and appears
    unresponsive".

    A fixed range with a clear refusal is the more predictable trade. Setting a default above
    the current scald limit fails with a message naming both numbers, rather than the slider
    silently having a different maximum than it had a moment ago. The valve's own guard
    (`GcsDevice.async_write_outlet_config`) refuses the same combination independently, so
    the rule holds even if something reaches past this entity.
