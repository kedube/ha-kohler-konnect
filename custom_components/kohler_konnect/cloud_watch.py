"""Cloud reachability for the Anthem valve — the one fact MQTT cannot carry.

# =====================================================================
# CLOUD CONNECTION WATCH
# =====================================================================

#     grep -rn "CLOUD CONNECTION WATCH" custom_components/kohler_konnect/
#
# That finds this module, the constants in `const.py`, the wiring in `coordinator.py`, and
# the entity in `binary_sensor.py`.
#
# =====================================================================

## The problem

The GCS valve drops off Kohler's cloud on its own, at random, and comes back only when it is
physically power-cycled. While it is gone the Konnect app shows it as cut off, Home Assistant
shows nothing at all, and the valve keeps working perfectly from the wall.

**MQTT cannot report this, ever.** Every message on that stream is published *by* the valve,
so a disconnect is silence — and the valve is silent most of the time anyway, because the
channel is event-driven. `GCS_SOLO_STS.IoTActive` looks purpose-built for the job and is
useless for the same reason: it read `Active` in 1 020 of 1 020 captured samples, because a
disconnected device cannot publish a message saying so.

## Why there is no silence threshold, and why this module does not use one

Measured across a 19-day capture corpus (2026-08-07 → 08-26):

===========================================================  ===========
Longest GCS silence provably benign (capture never stopped,
no reboot, valve answered a command at the end of it)          12 h 02 m
Longest benign silence observed at all                         35 h 49 m
The one real outage                                            12 h 22 m
===========================================================  ===========

The outage is **20 minutes longer than a known-good idle period**. Any threshold low enough
to catch it fires constantly on healthy quiet, and any threshold high enough to be quiet
misses it. So neither trigger below decides anything from silence. **Silence only decides
when to ask.** The answer always comes from `connectionState`, which is ground truth.

## The two triggers

**A — contradiction (needs a HUB).** The controller reports a zone `ON` while the valve says
nothing. This is the only signal in the corpus that separated the outage from 18 healthy
days: of 437 zone-`ON` `SHOWER_VALVE_STS` messages, 435 had a valve message within 60 s, and
**the only 2 that did not are the outage itself** — zero false positives over 435 healthy
samples. It fires within a minute rather than hours, and costs no network traffic to detect.

⚠️ **Zone `ON` only.** An all-`OFF` card gets republished with no valve action at all: the
controller emits its whole card set (`MUSIC_STS` + `SHOWER_VALVE_STS` + `STEAM_STS` +
`FAVORITE_STS` + `LIGHT_STS`) in one second during favorite activity, and every
`SHOWER_VALVE_STS` in the captured favorite bursts reads `z1:OFF z2:OFF`. The valve owes no
reply to an unchanged OFF card, so a missing valve message there means nothing. The `OFF`
variant is not merely noisier — it is evidentially empty.

**B — prolonged quiet (any account with a valve).** Trigger A can only see an outage the
controller happens to be awake for; measured against the corpus that is 36 % of all silence
time, and a GCS-only account has no controller at all. So after
:data:`CLOUD_CHECK_QUIET_SECONDS` with no valve message, ask once, then keep asking on that
interval while the quiet continues.

## What this is not

**It is not a polling loop.** `SCAN_INTERVAL` stays `None`; nothing here runs on a clock while
the valve is talking. Trigger A is driven by an arriving message. Trigger B's timer is reset
by every valve message, so on a normal day it never reaches its deadline — and when it does,
it is because the thing it watches has actually stopped.

## The earlier `Connection` sensor, and why this is not a repeat of it

An entity reporting `connectionState` existed once and was **deliberately removed** (see
`binary_sensor.py`). Its stated faults were that it was a fact about the plumbing rather than
the integration, that it *had no push source so it went stale as soon as polling was removed*,
and that a valve dropping off the cloud is fixed in the Konnect app rather than here.

The middle one was the real objection and it is the one this module answers: the field still
has no push source, so instead of polling it, **two push-driven events decide when to read
it**. The other two did not survive contact with 2026-08-26 — the owner needed exactly this
fact, and the app is where the problem *appeared*, not where it got fixed. It took a power
cycle.
