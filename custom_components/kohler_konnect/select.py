"""Favorite and experience selection for the Anthem valve and the Anthem Plus controller.

One dropdown that both **starts** a stored scene and **shows which one is running**, because
the valve reports the active scene itself (``presetOrExperienceId``) rather than leaving Home
Assistant to remember what it last sent. A scene started from the Konnect app or the
touchscreen therefore shows up here too.

**"Favorite" is the user-facing word; "preset" is the protocol word.** The Konnect app calls
these favorites, so that is what the entity is called. Everything below the entity layer
keeps Kohler's own vocabulary, because that is what the wire format and the documentation
use. Note the Anthem Plus *controller* has its own, unrelated favorites — those belong to
the "Anthem Plus" device, not this one.

⚠️ **The unique id and the state attributes keep the `favourite` spelling**, which the
entity name carried until 0.21.0. They are identifiers, not display text: moving the id
would orphan every automation and all recorded history, and renaming `favourite_count` or
`no_favourites_reason` would break whatever reads them. The name is what the owner sees,
and it is the only thing that changed.

    ⚠️ **Clearing on any coordinator update is not good enough**, and that is what all three
    selects here did until 2026-08-21. This coordinator pushes an update for *every* message
    the system sends, so the optimistic value was routinely dropped within milliseconds —
    while the device still reported the old value — and the dropdown visibly snapped back to
    the old option before jumping forward again when the real confirmation landed. The owner
    reported it as "flip flop", and the logs show exactly why:

    * **Warmup.** Selected at 00:21:53, confirmed by the REST readback at 00:21:55.586, MQTT
      echo at 00:21:56.399. Three coordinator updates inside that window, each one a
      snap-back.
    * **Controller favorite.** `FAVORITE_STS` for "Play Music" landed at 07:23:51.575, with
      `STEAM_STS` at 07:23:50.804 and `MUSIC_STS` at 07:23:51.054 arriving first — two clears
      before the one message that actually carried the answer.

    So the value is cleared on exactly two things: **the device agreeing**, or **the grace
    expiring**. A subclass supplies `_device_option`; this supplies `current_option`.

    The grace timer matters more than it looks. Without it a write the device silently
    ignored would leave the dropdown asserting something untrue until the next coordinator
    update happened to arrive — and this system has gone quiet for hours at a stretch. One of
    these dropdowns can start water, so it must not hold a claim it cannot support.

    Warmup runs water up to temperature before the session proper. This entity is the

    whether a warm-up is happening at this instant — those are two independent axes in the
    device's own state (``warmUpState.warmUp`` vs ``warmUpState.state``), and a control bound
    to the second reads "off" almost always, because a warm-up is over in seconds. "Warming
    Up" is reported by the valve Status sensor; both axes appear in the attributes here.

    **Three options** — ``Off``, ``All Outlets``, ``Started Outlets``, all with no start
    delay. These are the three modes the current Konnect app can write, but the labels are
    this integration's own since 2026-08-21 and no longer echo the app's wording; see
    ``WARMUP_LABELS`` in ``const.py``. Which outlets ``Started Outlets`` refers to is not
    exposed by any cloud API: it is per-zone `warmupOutlets` on the controller's local API,
    so this dropdown chooses the *mode* and the selection itself is configured on the device.

    ⚠️ **A valve can hold a mode this list does not offer.** Two legacy delayed-start values
    still parse in firmware. If the valve reports one, it is appended to the options for as
    long as it is in force, so the entity reports the truth rather than an error — but it is
    never on the menu otherwise, because nothing establishes what their delay does.

    ⚠️ **The Anthem Plus hub sets this back to Off on every signed-in use of its web UI.**
    Solved 2026-08-21: a fixed routine in the hub's firmware writes ``warmUpDisabled`` on
    every login/UI action — a PIN sign-in alone is enough — and no setting reachable from
    outside the hub prevents it. **If this dropdown moves to Off on its own, someone used
    the hub's web UI**; the Warmup Auto-Restore switch is the mitigation. See
    `docs/protocol/gcs_valve.md` §5.

    The value here is the REST field, `warmUpState.warmUp` — read at setup, on every MQTT
    reconnect, and again after every write, because a 200 from the cloud is not evidence the
    valve applied anything. The device's `GCS_WARM_STS` push corrects it too; measured
    2026-08-20, that echo lands **3.42 s** after the write and the REST field catches up on
    about the same schedule, which is why the confirmation is retried rather than read once.

    Two differences from the valve side worth knowing:

    * **Favorite ids are genuinely reassigned.** Deleting one shifts the others, confirmed
      by an `AllOff-omit` moving from id 6 to id 5 between two reads. GCS presets are fixed

      *activating* is allowed at any time. That is why the practical pattern is one
      favorite per state, switched by activation.

    Options come from the favorites list, which is seeded over REST and then kept current
